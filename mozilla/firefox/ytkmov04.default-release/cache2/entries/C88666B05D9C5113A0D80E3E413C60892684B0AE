WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:04.467
So how's the family?
Great.

00:04.546 --> 00:07.015
Kids are gettin' so big.
Haley's about to go off-

00:07.132 --> 00:09.681
You can stop holding your stomach in.
to college.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.262
You still exercising?

00:11.345 --> 00:12.892
Clearly.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.689
I look at a Clint Eastwood
or a Chuck Norris ...

00:14.765 --> 00:16.893
and I think, "There's no reason
I can't stay tough like"-

00:16.975 --> 00:18.602
Oh, tickles.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.235
But- Ow.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.529
That hurt?
No. Not-

00:24.608 --> 00:26.485
Ow.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.112
Hmm.
What?

00:28.195 --> 00:30.118
It's probably nothing.
You feeling okay?

00:30.239 --> 00:33.038
Yeah. Maybe we'll just run a
couple of tests just to be safe.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.957
What kind of tests? If there's
anything wrong, I'll give you a call.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.630
Oh. Okay.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.049
So, how's the real estate
market doing?

00:41.124 --> 00:43.923
Well, interest rates are low,
so it's a great time to be a buyer,

00:44.002 --> 00:46.004
but if you're a seller,
you really have to-

00:46.129 --> 00:48.598
Bend over. True, but a
quality property is still-

00:48.674 --> 00:51.302
No, no, no.
I need you to bend over.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.012
On. Right.

00:53.095 --> 00:57.271
Well, let's dim the lights, crank up the
Norah Jones and get this over with.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.942
Okay.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.437
Oh, hey, how'd it go?

01:01.520 --> 01:03.739
Amazing.
I was so proud of him.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.988
Oh, thanks, honey.
I'm kinda proud of me too.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.569
Look at what they gave me.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.121
"California State
Bar Association Award ...

01:11.196 --> 01:13.369
for distinguished service in the
field of environmental law."

01:13.490 --> 01:14.992
Wow.  You
should have seen it.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.749
They called his name. He went up on stage.
He gave a great speech.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.672
It was humble, inspirational,
with a touch of dry humor at the end.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.008
It was very Colin Firth.
Oh, Cam.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.838
Thank you, but it's hardly an Oscar.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.424
In the environmental law community,
it kind of is an Oscar.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.054
How was Lily?
I hope you weren't too bored.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.602
Oh, please.
Are you kidding me?

01:33.677 --> 01:35.896
I love talking to her.
She knows more words than Haley.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.099
Oh, that looks great
up there.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.230
How impressed are you
with your uncle right now?

01:41.310 --> 01:43.108
So impressed.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.281
I didn't want to ruin their moment by
telling them how many awards I've gotten,

01:46.356 --> 01:49.781
but let's just say I don't get out
of bed for a trophy that size.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.405
Darn it!

01:53.488 --> 01:55.911
I'm trying to send an e-mail.
This mouse keeps sticking.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.707
Pretty big reaction. it's]0 bucks, tops.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.791
You just reminded me
about my dream last night.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.798
I was in the middle of a meadow,
coming down a staircase.

02:06.877 --> 02:10.632
Then suddenly
a black mouse showed up.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.934
He stopped,
stared at me in the eyes ...

02:14.009 --> 02:15.977
and opened his little mouth.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.348
What'd it say?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.560
What did he say, Jay? He was a mouse.
They don't know how to talk.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.943
Now you're playing logic police? You're
standing on a staircase in a meadow?

02:26.021 --> 02:30.117
In my country, when somebody
dreams about a black mouse,

02:30.233 --> 02:32.986
it means that something bad is going to happen.
Ah, don't worry about it.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.619
I dreamt about a lucky blue cow.
We're good to go.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.995
Hey, Jay, this is what I'm
wearing for golfing tomorrow.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.294
Wanted to give you a heads up
in case there's some overlap.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.714
- What are you going for here?
- Matt Damon in Bagger Vance. You didn't get that?

02:43.789 --> 02:46.417
I did. I think you
look just like him.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
It's the whole reason
I asked you to teach me to golf.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.553
Any sport where
you can wear this, I'm in.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.600
Who is that?
It's]0:00 at night.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.514
I'll get it.
Hold on, Gatsby.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.346
Hola.
it's Javier. Open up!

02:59.429 --> 03:00.931
Dad!

03:01.890 --> 03:04.894
There's my campeÃ©n.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.478
There's your black mouse.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.689
Hola, Javier.
What are you doing in town?

03:08.772 --> 03:11.742
I missed Manny's birthday.
Plus, I have a free week.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.694
You're staying a week?
Make that go away.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.371
So, Manny, tomorrow, in honor
of you becoming a man,

03:16.446 --> 03:19.575
I am taking you to the racetrack
to enjoy the sport of kings.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.160
That's so cool!

03:21.243 --> 03:23.621
Actually, Manny and I have plans
to play golf tomorrow.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.753
Golfing? Psht! That is for old men
and for women who like women.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.210
Come on. Your dad is in town.
Let's go to the races.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.215
- Yeah! Can we all go?
- Ay, no, baby, I can't.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.843
I promised Haley that I was
gonna help her with her Spanish.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.638
But Jay's going to go with you.
What?

03:36.717 --> 03:40.347
I'm not gonna let Manny
take off with Javier by himself.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.933
Once, when Manny was six,
Javier took him to the Petting Zoo,

03:44.015 --> 03:48.316
which later I found out that was
the name of the stripper club.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.649
A real petting zoo
would have been cleaner.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.525
But I was looking forward to-
You're going.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.610
That I don't miss.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.155
# Hey, hey #

03:58.238 --> 04:00.332
# Hey, hey #

04:00.407 --> 04:02.284
# Hey, hey #

04:02.367 --> 04:04.244
# Hey, hey #

04:04.327 --> 04:05.749
# Hey ##

04:13.837 --> 04:15.464
Would you look at that.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.391
Oh. Yeah, you know, I never saw us
as "trophy on the mantel" people,

04:18.466 --> 04:20.094
but yours looks
so gosh darn good up there,

04:20.177 --> 04:22.179
I figured, why not be proud of
what we've done?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.764
Yeah.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.021
"First place,
bass-catcher spring fish-off.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.228
Missouri North Division."

04:29.311 --> 04:30.938
Two-day total
of 10 small-mouth bass ...

04:31.021 --> 04:32.739
weighing 34.24 pounds,

04:32.814 --> 04:34.942
with a four-and-a-half pound
kicker. Boom.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.824
So you beat all the other boys
aged 12 through 17?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.912
Mm-hmm. Sure did.
Wow.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.535
Look at our trophies
up there.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.492
We're a couple of winners,
aren't we?

04:44.493 --> 04:46.086
Are we?

04:46.161 --> 04:48.880
Claire?
Where are all my razor blades?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.377
- They're not in that box?
- No.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.551
- I guess they're gone.
- They can't be gone.

04:52.626 --> 04:57.553
In my 20s, I went on a game show and
won a lifetime supply of razor blades.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.475
Okay, Phil, time is up.
What is your answer?

05:00.550 --> 05:04.805
3.14159.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.141
Oh, I'm sorry, Phil.

05:07.224 --> 05:11.195
The correct answer is "banana
cream." Banana cream.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.613
Banana cream.
Well, you got me there, Chip.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.281
But you're not leaving
empty-handed.

05:15.357 --> 05:20.158
No, you're going home with a lifetime
supply of Genesis twin-blade razors.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.990
What? Two blades in one razor?

05:23.073 --> 05:25.167
Man, it'll never get better
than that!

05:27.035 --> 05:30.039
You must have used 'em all up.
They said a lifetime supply.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.624
Honey, you got 15 years
of free razor blades.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.550
Put that in the "win" column
and move on.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.971
Mom, is it okay
if my friend Walt comes over ...

05:38.046 --> 05:39.514
to play Rebel Fighters 3?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.182
Honey, don't you think
it's a little weird ...

05:41.299 --> 05:43.518
that one of your best friends
is an 80-year-old man? No.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.062
It makes it more fun
because he was in a real war.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.687
He says cool things like,
"See ya in hell, Klaus."

05:49.766 --> 05:52.269
I don't even
know what that means.

05:52.352 --> 05:56.277
Oh, hey, Dad.
Some doctor called for you.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.321
Dr. Sendroff?
Yeah, that's it.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.863
You were in the shower.
What did he say?

05:59.943 --> 06:02.867
He wants you to call him
right away.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.199
Oh, well.
See ya in hell, Klaus.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.955
What's wrong?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.956
I don't know. He ran a few
tests on me yesterday.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.709
He said he'd call if something
was wrong, and now he's calling.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.415
Hi. This is Phil Dunphy.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.047
I'm returning Dr. Sendroff's call.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.252
Are you serious?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.471
What?
He's on a flight to London.

06:19.546 --> 06:23.892
Is there any way I can reach him or,
uh, someone else I can talk to?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.094
Okay. Fine.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.850
Please, just tell him it's urgent.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.897
Thank you.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.601
- Oh, boy.
- Honey, I'm sure it's nothing.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.561
Claire, I'm tender under my arm.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.488
Maybe Luke hit you with his broomstick
when you guys were playing quidditch.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.737
I'm way too fast.
He never touched me.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.614
I can assure you,
you are perfectly fine.

06:41.693 --> 06:45.368
That's very comforting, coming from a
marketing major at a party school.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.581
I
like the number four horse.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.086
He loves this track.
His dad won the Preakness.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.089
Last three finishes
were in the money.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.011
I like Miranda's Miracle.
Why?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.885
There's this girl, Miranda, in my
class, and she's really pretty.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.433
And if she liked me back,
it'll be a miracle.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.727
Would you bet two dollars
on that one for me, Jay?

07:07.844 --> 07:10.814
Sure, but you're throwing your money away.
You both are.

07:10.889 --> 07:14.644
The winner of the race will
be number seven, My Hometown.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.603
Number seven.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.781
Well, he's carrying three extra
pounds and he hates the distance.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.529
Those are just words
on a page.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.235
I look the horse in the eye,

07:23.360 --> 07:26.284
and he tells me he is the winner.
Tells you, huh?

07:26.404 --> 07:29.374
Perhaps this will sound crazy to
you- No need for the qualifier.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.044
But I have always been able to
see into the soul of a horse.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.588
It is a gift,
and I do not question it.

07:35.664 --> 07:39.043
Just like I always end up on
the shortest line at the bank.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.468
Maybe I should bet
on your horse.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.966
Are you kidding me?
These aren't just words.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.844
They give you
all this information ...

07:44.923 --> 07:47.972
so you can make an informed
decision and beat the odds.

07:48.051 --> 07:51.305
Yes, of course, and this is why
everybody with a racing form is rich.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.311
Now come on.
It's time to place our bets.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.892
What's it gonna be, Manny?

07:58.603 --> 08:01.607
Two dollars on My Hometown. You
really think he's going to win?

08:01.690 --> 08:03.567
Well, I only know what he
tells me with his eyes.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.994
Don't ask me why,
but maybe in some previous life ...

08:06.069 --> 08:07.537
I was a horse.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.239
Or part of a horse.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.586
Hey. Alex called. She left her cell phone here.
She's gonna come back and get it.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.176
Cam, did you do something to
your fish trophy? Oh, yeah.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.924
I forgot about
this fun middle part.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.097
Now it looks like the fish
is jumping out of the water.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.845
Yeah. Right over mine.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.392
Do I sense something,
Mitchell?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.765
You know, just because mine's
a little taller than yours ...

08:31.845 --> 08:33.518
doesn't make yours
any less important.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.724
Oh, no.
That's not what I was feeling.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.980
Not even a little bit.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.528
Oh, my God, you don't like
that I put my trophy up.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.356
I just think it's a little weird that
immediately after I win a trophy,

08:43.440 --> 08:47.195
you feel the need to dig this thing
up and plop it down next to mine.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.656
I'll have you know that I've wanted
to display this for quite some time,

08:50.739 --> 08:53.583
but I put it in a box in the garage
with all my other awards-

08:53.658 --> 08:55.160
yes, awards-

08:55.243 --> 08:58.998
out of courtesy
to a sadly award-less you.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.878
It looks ridiculous.

09:00.957 --> 09:05.554
Mine is a distinguished professional
award given to me by my peers,

09:05.628 --> 09:08.131
and yours was
given to you on a pier.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.889
Okay. For your information,
when I won this, it was a very big deal.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.938
I cut a ribbon at the grocery store
and signed autographs.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.812
"Best fishes, Cameron Tucker."

09:19.559 --> 09:21.061
Oh, you know what?
I just remembered.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.272
Mine comes with
a really fun pedestal too.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.198
Ohh! Look at that.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.115
Oh, and proper hierarchy is restored.
Mm-hmm.

09:29.194 --> 09:32.994
Unless you suddenly remember
that your fish came with a top hat.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.541
Okay. Well, you know what?

09:34.657 --> 09:37.957
I'm going to go get Lily from her
party and go to the park. Okay.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.709
This award has changed you,
Mitchell.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.836
You may be flying high now,
but pretty soon ...

09:41.915 --> 09:45.169
you're gonna be
free fallin', Tom Petty.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.128
Because you're petty.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.089
Tom Petty. Hmm? Get it?

09:49.214 --> 09:51.888
About three sentences ago.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.227
Hola, Haley.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.804
Hi, Gloria.
Thanks for comin' over.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.764
En espafiol, par favor.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.566
Uh, hola, Gloria.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.644
Gracias for comin' over.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.229
No, the whole thing.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.282
I don't know the whole thing.
Why do I even need to learn Spanish?

10:07.357 --> 10:09.530
I live in California.
I'm never gonna use it.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.328
That's the problem with Americans.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.497
They expect all of us
to know their language,

10:14.572 --> 10:16.745
but they don't even
make the effort to learn ours.

10:16.825 --> 10:20.420
Win a war some time.
Then we'll start talking like you.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.873
Huh! So wrong.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.379
- Oh. Hey, Gloria.
- Hi, Phil. How are you?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.335
- I wish I knew.
- Why? What's wrong?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.091
Oh, I don't want to bum you out.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.844
My doctor did some tests and said
he'd call if something was wrong,

10:31.923 --> 10:33.550
and he called this morning.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.349
What did he say? I don't know. I missed the call.
Now I can't reach him.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.930
The black mouse.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.729
What? In my dream.
It was a bad omen.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.435
But probably not for you.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.029
The staircase!

10:47.105 --> 10:48.823
No, no, no.
You're fine, you're fine.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.992
Am I? Get this.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.695
Fifteen years ago,
I won a lifetime supply of razor blades.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.826
They ran out ... today.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.460
What's with the spitting?
Are you warding off death?

11:00.535 --> 11:02.003
No. When I did-

11:02.078 --> 11:04.422
I think I suck in a little bug.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.375
Sixteen for the first race,

11:07.458 --> 11:10.052
ten from the second race,
plus 34.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.222
Sixty dollars!
You're a genius, Dad.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.970
Well, I cannot
take all the credit.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.392
It is a particularly chatty group
of horses today.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.344
I love gambling!
it's so easy.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.096
It's not easy.
Well, not for you.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.855
- You've lost, what, three in a row?
- Oh, burn, Jay.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.812
I'm sorry. That was uncalled for.
This is all so heady.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.897
Fifty dollars on Little Bacon to win.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.945
Yeah, uy.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.573
- What? What ooh-ee?
- There is something not right about that horse.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.536
I think I saw it too.
You didn't see anything.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.707
This horse is a heavy favorite. The rest of
the pack couldn't beat a merry-go-round.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.409
- I'm stickin' with Little Bacon.
- It's your funeral.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.629
Who are we goin' with, Dad?
Nobody in this race, papito.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.799
It was quiet down there in the
paddock just now. Too quiet.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.922
Oh, gee. You know what?
Make it 300.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.218
Oh, my.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.467
I'm tellin' you, kid, this is the one.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.219
And you know how I know?

11:55.298 --> 11:57.642
'Cause it said-

11:58.426 --> 11:59.928
They don't talk like that.

12:01.679 --> 12:07.561
"Maria bought a beautiful
white dress for her wedding."

12:07.644 --> 12:08.736
Um-

12:08.811 --> 12:11.405
Maria comporÃ³ ...

12:11.481 --> 12:16.487
un hermoso vestido bianco
para su-

12:16.569 --> 12:17.570
I- I'm sorry.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.201
I cannot concentrate
with him here.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.157
What are you doing?

12:22.158 --> 12:24.001
Just taking it all in.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.130
You're a beautiful,
intelligent woman,

12:31.209 --> 12:33.086
and don't you ever forget it.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.596
Wow. He is so weird sometimes.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.143
No, he's not weird!

12:40.218 --> 12:43.563
He's a saint, and you will
miss him when he's gone!

12:43.638 --> 12:45.140
One day.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.942
Hey, Uncle Mitchell.
Hey.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.815
Your, uh, phone's on the table.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.233
- Uh, what's that?
- Oh, Cam's old fishing trophy.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.660
Yeah, when I woke up this morning,
that's where I found it.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.033
- Right after you got yours?
- Thank you!

13:00.113 --> 13:01.990
Oh, my God.
Welcome to my world.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.496
Last week, I got this beautiful plaque
from the debate team ...

13:04.575 --> 13:06.577
for outstanding achievement,
and what did my morn do?

13:06.661 --> 13:08.129
She found one of Luke's
participant ribbons ...

13:08.204 --> 13:10.673
and a certificate Haley got for
showing up somewhere on time ...

13:10.748 --> 13:12.967
and put all three of them
together on the same shelf.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.544
It's, like, so unfair.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.300
I was so glad
I talked to Alex ...

13:16.379 --> 13:18.973
because she agreed with every
single thing I was feeling,

13:19.048 --> 13:24.100
which made me realize that I was
acting like a 14-year-old girl.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.265
Okay.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.646
Yeah. Yeah. Aaah!

13:29.726 --> 13:31.569
Come on, kid.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.739
I just lost an arm because of you.
Now get your head in the game.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.660
Sorry. I can't concentrate
with my dad staring at me.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.203
I just love you so much.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.280
I hope he's talkin' to you.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.834
Uh! Oh, great. Now I'm dead.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.627
I'm going to the bathroom.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.205
You know,
they say that happens.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.877
Hey, Walt.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.514
You ever think about death?

14:00.590 --> 14:03.343
I'm 85.
Death is my roommate.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.178
I got a call from the doctor.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.639
There's a 60% chance I'm gonna die.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.521
Ha! Doctors. Said I'd
be dead 10 years ago.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.227
Look at me.
I'm healthy as a-

14:13.561 --> 14:16.405
Oh. Gotta go change my tank.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.363
- Phil, you gotta let this go.
- I'm sorry, Claire.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.197
I don't know how to react
when I find out ...

14:24.280 --> 14:26.328
there's a 70% chance I'm gonna die.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.126
Honey. Listen to me.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.749
You're gonna be fine.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.419
You really think so?
I know so.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.967
Claire's my rock.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.885
You know when you're on a plane
and there's turbulence,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.086
you look at the flight attendants,

14:39.170 --> 14:40.513
and if they're still smiling
and serving drinks,

14:40.588 --> 14:41.885
you know everything's
gonna be okay?

14:41.964 --> 14:44.092
That's Claire.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.428
I could also picture her as a cop.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.639
... and into the
final furlong, it's Little Bacon,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.223
followed by Brad's Wax Jacket-

14:50.306 --> 14:52.024
Go, Little Bacon!
Go, Little Bacon!

14:52.100 --> 14:53.852
You got this.
You got this.

14:53.935 --> 14:57.690
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- And the winner is number nine, Little Bacon.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.241
Yes! I knew it!

15:00.316 --> 15:02.535
You see that, Manny?
Dumb luck always runs out.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.033
But if you live in the real
world and you use your head,

15:05.113 --> 15:08.538
not have it in the clouds like
Dr. Dolittle there, you'll do okay.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.368
Guess you should've listened
to Jay on this one, Dad.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.419
You got that right.
You should have listened to Jay.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.997
I'll tell you somethin' else.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.424
You can't look in a horse's eyes
and tell there's something wrong.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.343
You can't even look in their eyes at the same time.
One's here and one's here.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.638
Come on, let's go
to the window, kid.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.305
I may need some help
carrying my winnings.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.678
Oh, wait.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.844
Jay, look.
Huh?

15:28.511 --> 15:29.933
Inquiry.

15:30.054 --> 15:33.524
What's that? It is when a horse
has committed an infraction.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.273
Possible infraction. Usually
it's nothing. I'm sure-

15:36.352 --> 15:37.854
The number nine horse,
Little Bacon,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.530
has been disqualified
for interference.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.901
What? The winner is number
six, Brad's Wax Jacket.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.736
Ah. You see?

15:44.819 --> 15:46.321
The eyes-

15:47.196 --> 15:48.823
they do not lie.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.493
Tough break, Jay.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.621
Here.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.422
Little something for gas.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.265
Cam was right.
I was being petty.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.139
So I found his box
of old trophies,

16:09.218 --> 16:12.518
and! decided to surprise him by having
them on the mantel when he got home.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.895
Well, I was the one
who was surprised.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.397
I had no idea
how many trophies he had.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.650
First place, and all of them
for different things.

16:19.729 --> 16:24.405
Music, football, an' show,
science fair, a chili cook-ofii

16:24.484 --> 16:28.455
A lifetime of accolades hidden away,
just so I wouldn't feel bad.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.741
Ugh! That's a mouse.
That's a- Oh!

16:31.824 --> 16:33.246
Ugh!

16:33.326 --> 16:35.624
Oh, disgusting!

16:36.913 --> 16:39.666
No, no. No, Cam.
I-l was gonna make a big display.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.422
I believe you have.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.427
No, no, Cam,
there was a-

16:43.503 --> 16:45.380
Oh! Gross!

16:51.511 --> 16:55.812
Listen, Manny, do me a favor and get me a
cappuccino from right over there, okay?

16:55.890 --> 16:57.938
No, it's okay. I got it.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.858
So-

17:01.979 --> 17:05.279
You want to talk about what
happened back there? Not at all.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.828
You know, it is not just the horses whose
souls I can read through their eyes.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.621
All right. You really want to know?
I'll tell you.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.076
Okay. I'll leave you alone.
Ah, listen, hang on.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.287
I'm sorry I went after you
like that in front of Manny.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.713
That was wrong.

17:18.788 --> 17:22.713
No, I get it. Nobody likes
to lose at the races, hmm?

17:22.791 --> 17:25.045
I don't owe this guy anything.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.551
He stops by a couple of times
a year to see his kid.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.054
It used to be a relief.
Gave me a nice break.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.431
But now Manny and I,
we got our own thing.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.605
Look, I know I'm not his dad.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.976
Maybe I don't like the reminder.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.481
Hey. What's up?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.531
Oh, my gosh.
What?

17:45.648 --> 17:47.992
We came as soon as we heard.
Heard what?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.694
We heard Phil got bad news
from the doctor.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.913
No. Who told you that?
Gloria.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.538
No. I didn't say
that he got bad news.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.036
I said that he was
getting bad news. Shh.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.087
You don't know
that he's getting bad news.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.630
I saw a black mouse.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.299
I saw a black mouse!

18:03.416 --> 18:04.884
So he says.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.257
- Okay, you guys-
- This is worse than I thought!

18:07.336 --> 18:09.009
No, it's not.
Listen to me. Listen.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.932
Phil is fine. As a matter of fact, you
should go before he even knows you're here.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.972
No, no. We're staying. We're staying.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.936
We got here as soon as we could.
Oh, my God.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.561
- Did you bring the coffee cake?
- Yes, I have it right here.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.437
He carried it in from the car.
I paid for it.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.644
Listen. Listen to me.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.946
I am very sorry for what
you are going through.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.364
Thank you.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.407
- Who is this?
- Who indeed?

18:28.482 --> 18:30.484
I am Javier Delgado,
Manny's father ...

18:30.610 --> 18:33.454
and Gloria's former
husband and lover. Oh.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.531
I hope you do not think
this is insensitive,

18:35.615 --> 18:38.334
but you are a beautiful woman, and
you will have no trouble to find a-

18:38.409 --> 18:41.538
Javier, the body
is not even cold yet.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.376
The body is upstairs watching basketball.
He is fine.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.797
Gloria said he was sick.
No. He went to the doctor.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.096
He had some tests.
The doctor called. That's it.

18:50.171 --> 18:54.551
Plus, today he ran out
of his lifetime supply of razors.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.308
That's a sign.
This is a lot of hocus-pocus.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.480
I can't believe I bought
a coffee cake over this!

18:59.555 --> 19:02.434
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I'm-I'm confused.
What did the doctor say exactly?

19:02.516 --> 19:05.235
I don't know.
We missed his call this morning.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.359
- The doctor called on Saturday?
- Yeah. So?

19:07.438 --> 19:08.610
Nothing.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.783
Not nothing. Not nothing.
What?

19:11.525 --> 19:12.993
Well, it's just that, uh,

19:13.069 --> 19:15.572
doctors don't usually call
on Saturday with good news.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.330
But they could call.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.999
I mean, he could call
with anything.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.873
Do you think he's sick, Dad?

19:20.951 --> 19:23.955
What's- What's going on?

19:24.038 --> 19:25.836
Nothing. Nothing.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.667
Everybody just came by
for absolutely no reason at all.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.424
- You look worried.
- I'm not worried.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.005
Oh, God.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.715
The plane's in trouble.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.846
You put away the drink cart
and you're strappin' in.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.718
You're gonna be fine, kid.
You are gonna be great.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.060
I wish I looked
as good as this kid.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.481
Stop. Please.
You're freaking me out.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.058
- Are you gonna die?
- I don't know!

19:44.141 --> 19:45.984
There's still
a five percent chance I'll make it!

19:49.980 --> 19:51.482
It's Dr. Sendroff.
Okay.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.569
Guys, I don't know what's on the
other end of this phone call,

19:54.652 --> 19:56.404
but whatever happens,

19:56.487 --> 19:59.206
I just want you to know you've already
given me a lifetime supply of happiness.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.783
I remember once, as a-

20:00.866 --> 20:02.209
The phone!
Answer it!

20:02.284 --> 20:03.831
Do it!

20:03.911 --> 20:05.333
Dr. Sendroff.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.915
What's the word?

20:09.875 --> 20:13.800
- Are you serious?
- What?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.472
- That's it?
- What is it?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.141
Hold on one second.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.469
He's calling about a real estate listing.
I'm fine.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.054
Oh, my-
Ay, no.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.481
Yesterday, you said you'd call
if something was wrong.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.480
Then you called.
Then you disappeared.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.937
That is the most irresponsible,
unprofessional thing ...

20:29.019 --> 20:30.862
I've ever heard of
in my entire life,

20:30.938 --> 20:34.442
and do you have anyone to represent you
in the sale of your current house?

20:34.525 --> 20:35.868
Look into his eyes.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.366
I don't care what the doctor says,
I give him six months.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.287
Stop staring.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.668
So, Phil Dunphy, tell
us a little bit about yourself.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.504
Well, Chip, I'm married
to a great lady- Hi, Claire-

20:54.587 --> 20:56.055
and I have a baby girl.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.724
Um, I'm a real estate agent,
and I enjoy playing checkers-

20:58.841 --> 21:00.684
Okay.
both Chinese and American.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.479
And, uh, I am a fan of hip-hop.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.056
Well, good for you.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.562
Though I try to stay neutral in the
whole East Coast West Coast thang.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.435
Next up, we have-
Oh, one quick thing.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.486
Shout out to my, uh, college
buddy, Ling,

21:11.562 --> 21:14.691
who built his own helicopter and
is taking his first flight today.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.865
And, uh, I also want to wish a happy anniversary
to my in-laws, Jay and Dede Pritchett.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.493
Your eternal love
is an inspiration to us all.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.370
Okay, that's enough.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.123
Next up, we have homemaker from
West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.499
