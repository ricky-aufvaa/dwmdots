WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:06.508
- Honey, what is all this?
- Hey.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.935
Hey, Mom, I'm trying to write this
stupid college essay question,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.809
- and I really don't even know where to start.
- What's the question? Tell me.

00:12.888 --> 00:16.017
"What's the biggest obstacle
you've ever had to overcome?"

00:16.099 --> 00:19.023
Didn't my third-grade teacher
say I had, like, A.D.D. or something?

00:19.102 --> 00:22.231
Oh, no, honey.
She said you couldn't A-D-D,

00:22.314 --> 00:25.238
and she put it that way because she
also knew you couldn't S-P-E-L-L.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.781
Wait. Slow down.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.157
Ohh!

00:28.278 --> 00:32.078
Sweetheart, what's this? We
talked about this last week.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.706
I said I'm building Luke a tree house.
You said "Fine."

00:34.785 --> 00:37.459
You know, sometimes I think
you just tune me out.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.712
I never told her.
She just would've said no.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.214
I don't remember agreeing
to this, Phil.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.387
This is like the time you
backed down the driveway ...

00:45.462 --> 00:47.135
with a hang glider
sticking out of the car.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.717
If you'd let me keep that, those geese
would've followed me to the wetlands.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.809
You would have died.
A hero.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.604
So we spread out a nice blanket,
open up a bottle of vino ...

00:57.683 --> 01:00.732
and watch the sun set
over the water.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.320
It was majestic.  Mmm.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.529
Majestic.
Majestic.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.108
Ay. Why we never
have the picnic?

01:06.233 --> 01:09.362
Who wants to sit on a blanket? There's
no back support. it's majestic.

01:09.444 --> 01:13.574
Last week, Shorty took me
to see the Cirque du Soleil.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.501
It's like a circus, but classy.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.877
So if you like elephants,
don't hold your breath.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.374
She's so cute.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.586
Jay hate the crowds,
the beach, the rainbows.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.763
Rainbows.
That's just colors in the sky.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.723
Do we have to pull over every time
and take a picture?  Shame.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.847
There's an expression
in Italian, Jay:

01:32.926 --> 01:38.228
Dammi la tua mano e corriamo
uniti per tutta la vita.

01:38.307 --> 01:42.028
"Give me your hand and we will
run together our whole lives."

01:42.102 --> 01:44.696
Aww. Jay
also hates running.

01:46.982 --> 01:54.992
# Hey, hey #

01:55.073 --> 01:56.245
# Hey ##

01:58.076 --> 02:00.374
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.173
- And here you go.
- Ohh. What is this?

02:03.248 --> 02:05.296
You said to knock
your socks off.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.299
Oh? Well, look. it's already working.

02:08.377 --> 02:11.222
Two more of those, and you won't
be wearing any underwear either.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.183
Oh, look!
Cam, down. Down.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.018
Maybe later.
Oh, okay.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.640
Maybe- Maybe later.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.973
Did you hear that? The
waitress is flirting with me.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.478
No, no. She's not
flirting with you.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.811
She's trolling for tips, okay?
She totally knows you're gay.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.646
How would she know I'm gay?

02:25.771 --> 02:29.116
Uh, maybe it's the way you ordered
a "drink-a-doodle-doo."

02:29.232 --> 02:31.735
Cam has this crazy theory that if he
were straight ...

02:31.818 --> 02:34.537
And Julia Roberts were single,
they'd be dating.

02:34.613 --> 02:38.334
It's not crazy. I met her once at an AIDS
walk, and our chemistry was palpable.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.748
No, you handed her a bottle of water.
And her fingers lingered.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.829
Because you wouldn't let go.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.504
I could totally pick up
any woman in here.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.712
If by that you mean lift her off the
ground, then yes, I'll give you that.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.672
I for sure could be a womanizer.

02:51.755 --> 02:55.009
Or you could be someone who just stepped
out a machine called The Womanizer.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.515
Okay, you know what? That's it.
Pick anyone in here,

02:57.594 --> 03:00.017
and if I can get their number,
you do the laundry for a month.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.895
If I fail, I'll do it.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.109
Okay, I hate doing
laundry, so, um- Mm-hmm.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.858
No. Um-

03:06.937 --> 03:08.985
Oh, okay.
Right here.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.486
Her.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.029
Okay, great. Great.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.366
Just get rid of my flair.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.792
Whoa. Where-
Where did Cam go?

03:20.867 --> 03:24.337
Where is he?

03:24.454 --> 03:27.253
- Dinner was absolutely wonderful.
- Amazing.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.051
You know what? Why don't you guys come
salsa dancing with us tomorrow night?

03:30.127 --> 03:31.970
Oh, yeah.
That would be great!

03:32.045 --> 03:33.968
A y, it sounds like so much fun.
I love salsa dancing.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.765
Jay, let's go
salsa dancing with them.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.935
Look.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.476
Why not? I just bought
that pay-per-view fight.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.057
I'll tell you what.
We'll compromise.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.268
We'll watch the fight,
we'll eat salsa.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.229
- Who needs him? Come dancing with us.
- A y, no. I wouldn't want to-

03:48.311 --> 03:50.530
No, no, you'd be
doing me a favor.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.449
Shorty never wants to stop,
and I could use a break.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.368
You hear that, Jay?
I never stop.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.947
All I hear is
she could use a break.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.793
Hey. Oh, my God.
How are you?

04:02.909 --> 04:05.913
Hey. Hey!
Wow.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.795
Look at you.
You look fantastic.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.047
Thank you. S-So do you.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.799
How long has it been?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.887
F-Feels like forever.
Yeah.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.261
What, um- When is the last
time we saw each other?

04:17.339 --> 04:19.341
Oh, let's see. I think
it was at Dave's thing.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.980
You know what?
I'm sorry.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.182
I don't know
if you've heard.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.142
I was in
a terrible car accident,

04:27.225 --> 04:30.229
and ever since the coma,

04:30.312 --> 04:34.362
I have a really hard time
placing names and faces.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.032
So who are you again?
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.535
It was just a clever way to try to approach you.
We don't know each other.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.287
I've never been in a coma.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.664
But you so deserved that.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.963
That was
the worst pick-up ever.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.003
Oh, my God!

04:51.082 --> 04:54.086
That was genius
and mean!

04:54.169 --> 04:57.218
Now I know why
we're old fake friends.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.391
Can I buy you a drink?
Yeah.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.807
I'm Katie.
Cameron.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.356
If she were a hot guy, I would
never have been that smooth.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.935
It's ironic.
Like the Gift of the Vagi.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.690
There we go.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.068
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
You too.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.823
Bye.
Bye.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.579
Wham, bam,
thank you, Cam.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.074
Seriously. You got her number?
Sure did.

05:24.157 --> 05:28.458
And all my shirts get ironed, and their seams
should appear straight, just like their owner.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.680
Shouldn't you be using
screws instead of nails?

05:38.755 --> 05:41.634
America was built
with nails, Son.

05:41.716 --> 05:45.311
So was that gazebo you built
for our Fourth of July party.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.186
I'm telling you,
you are gonna love this bad boy.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.188
You know
what can't climb trees?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.606
Raccoons?
Worries.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.780
Raccoons can and will get up
here, so don't leave any food,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.028
or they'll get territorial
and attack.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.527
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Are you kidding me?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.988
You're gonna have so much fun hanging
out up here with your buddies.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.415
Trust me. When you get
older, it all changes.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.035
Why?
Well, life gets in the way.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.001
Did I just say "wife gets in the way"?
'Cause sometimes I do that.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.548
Nope, you're good.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.091
And you have
lots of friends.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.010
Yeah, I have work friends, and your
mom and I have couples friends,

06:18.086 --> 06:22.057
and there are my college friends, but
they're scattered all over the country.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.726
It's not the same as just shouting
out to your neighborhood buddies,

06:24.801 --> 06:26.895
"Hey, fellas, I'm up here
in the tree house!"

06:26.970 --> 06:30.440
Oh! I gotta fix
that ... board.

06:33.518 --> 06:37.193
I can't do this. Why
are you so frustrated?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.900
Because I've never had
any obstacles to overcome.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.361
Oh, honey,
that's not true.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.658
Really? Name one.
Well-

06:46.531 --> 06:48.249
You're lactose
intolerant.

06:48.325 --> 06:51.920
Oh. "Dear college, cheese makes me gassy.
See you in September."

06:51.995 --> 06:55.295
Sweetie, you're not really starting
your essays "Dear college," are you?

06:55.373 --> 06:59.594
What difference does it make? I've lived
a boring, sheltered, pathetic life.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.889
I am sorry we have made things too
easy and comfortable for you.

07:02.964 --> 07:06.264
Oh, you should be.
it is all your fault.

07:06.343 --> 07:10.098
You have shielded me from everything
interesting and dangerous.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.810
You are blaming me because I
kept you from getting hurt?

07:13.892 --> 07:15.439
Gabby's mom's a hoarder.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.566
That essay
practically writes itself.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.115
Maybe it is our fault.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.694
But did you ever consider
there's a reason?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.370
What are you talking about?

07:27.072 --> 07:30.667
There's a reason
why we were so easy on you.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.212
- I don't understand.
- Oh, honey, you're old enough now.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.506
- Old enough for what?
- The truth.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.630
Okay, come on.
Gotta show you something.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.963
- We're gonna go for a ride.
- Mom, just tell me.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.011
You are my mom, right?

07:46.091 --> 07:48.514
Oh, hey.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.346
- I'm a bad man.
- Oh, no. What did you eat?

07:51.429 --> 07:54.433
Mitchell, remember the girl
I met last night?

07:54.516 --> 07:57.816
How can I forget her? She's super famous
for having the world's worst gaydar.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.693
How could I be so cavalier
with her emotions?

08:00.772 --> 08:03.742
You know, we had a real connection.
She gave me her number.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.991
And right now, she's probably sitting
by the phone, waiting for me to call.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.118
Uh-huh.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.201
I don't think you understand
how charmed she was by me.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.162
Oh, my God. Where did you
get all this self-confidence?

08:15.245 --> 08:18.715
I won Cutest Baby
at the 1974 Jasper County Fair.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.792
People at the time
said I could go Gerber.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.841
You know what? I'm calling her.
What?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.139
No, I can't carry this around.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.592
I have to come clean so she
can move on with her life.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.303
This is crazy. She
is not waiting by the-

08:31.386 --> 08:33.730
Hi. Katie, it's Cam.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.273
First ring.

08:35.347 --> 08:39.774
- I was hoping I would call too.
- Oh, smooth.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.356
So listen, I forgot
to mention something last night,

08:42.438 --> 08:46.694
and I'm- I'm actually not really
quite sure how to say this.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.370
"I'm a gay guy."

08:49.446 --> 08:51.790
Um, it's actually
somewhat delicate.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.867
"As am I,
on account of the gay."

08:53.950 --> 08:56.123
No, no. I had a great
time with you too, Katie.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.588
It's- Well, it's just that-
"I don't dig the ladies."

08:58.663 --> 09:02.839
No, no, and I want you to sit. I want
you to have a seat on a chaise lounge.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.841
Hey, you wanna go out and grab some
dinner before the fight tonight?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.593
No, thank you.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.140
Wanna eat at home?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.593
I'll grill some steaks,
open a bottle of wine.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.395
Whatever you want, because
I'm not going to be here.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.395
She's going salsa dancing-
without me.

09:17.474 --> 09:21.195
Ay, Manny, I told you.
it's a 21-and-over club.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.692
A forbidden dance floor.
Only makes me want it more.

09:23.772 --> 09:27.447
Wait a second. You're going
dancing with Shorty and Darlene?

09:27.525 --> 09:31.621
Yes. Because even though he's old
like you, he still likes to have fun.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.075
We like to have fun.
Last week, I took you to dinner.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.911
Went to the boat show.
Got some sherbet.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.543
And were home by 8:30
with no boat.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.750
What do you want from me?
I don't like dancing.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.547
I don't like sherbet.
Yeah, right.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.048
How about coconut?

09:46.127 --> 09:48.846
Who doesn't like the coconut?
Hmm? Who?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.890
And anyways, I'm going
dancing with or without you.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.933
Fine. I hope you have
a good time with Shorty.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.636
I don't need Shorty.

09:54.719 --> 09:58.314
I won't have any problem
finding a partner on my own.

09:58.389 --> 10:01.142
Wow.
Way to rub it in, Mom.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.777
How'd it go, heartbreaker?

10:06.856 --> 10:10.531
That is one classy lady.
Which is why I couldn't tell her.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.113
- What?
- Well, I just couldn't do it on the phone.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.324
She seemed so excited
to hear from me,

10:15.406 --> 10:17.750
and I'm very bad at
disappointing people, Mitchell.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.749
Not all people.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.082
Mama was right when she said my
charm was like a wild stallion.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.542
If not properly bridled,
it'll bust down a barn.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.549
Okay, you wanna get rid of your
girlfriend, tell her that story.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.256
Maybe I will when she comes over.
She's coming over.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.591
Are you serious?

10:32.674 --> 10:34.597
She said she was in the
area, running errands.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.599
What was I was supposed to say?
"Don't come over"?

10:36.678 --> 10:38.897
Well, I guess I could've said
that, but it's too late now.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.315
Plus, I wanna break it
to her gently.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.063
So come on.
Help me un-gay the place.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.437
You know what? I'll make it less gay by half.
Oh, these flowers should go too.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.943
You mean the ones underneath the
portrait of you cuddling another man?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.615
Oh, good catch.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.743
Ohh!

10:54.070 --> 10:56.323
Manny.
What's up, big guy?

10:56.447 --> 10:59.917
How hard is it to learn this salsa
dancing stuff? Not hard at all.

10:59.993 --> 11:04.544
It's about tapping into your emotion,
your passion and your inner fire.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.216
Crap!

11:07.292 --> 11:08.965
I stink at dancing.

11:09.043 --> 11:12.138
First dance at our wedding, Gloria
was all graceful and gorgeous,

11:12.213 --> 11:16.309
and I was all big and clunky, like
that scene from Beauty and the Beast

11:16.384 --> 11:18.057
Actually, that was the song.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.763
Manny picked it.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.769
He didn't like me back then.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.691
Salsa ]

11:23.766 --> 11:25.939
Back straight.
Okay, do as I do.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.692
Other leg.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.741
Okay, stop marching. You're
dancing, not invading Poland.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.369
Hello. Hi.
Looking for Jay Pritchett.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.547
He's about 6'2", tough guy,
wrestles with homophobia.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.165
The hell are you doing here?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.841
I had to get
out of the house.

11:48.917 --> 11:52.421
Cam needed a little alone time with
his new girlfriend. Don't ask.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.846
Don't tell.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.924
- What's going on here?
- He's learning to dance.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.097
But he's just so tense.
It's not working out.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.811
'Cause you're not letting go.
I'm trying.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.935
Don't you think I wanna be all smooth
and make your mom happy out there?

12:03.014 --> 12:04.937
But I just can't do it,
that's all.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.609
Jay, I'm not giving up on you.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.608
Okay. Hey, Manny, would
you give us a second?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.901
Oh.
Thanks.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.607
Dad, look.

12:12.690 --> 12:16.035
L- I know this is weird,
but you and I are a lot alike.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.862
You're self-conscious, okay?

12:17.987 --> 12:21.662
So, um- Here. Just-
The hell is this?

12:21.741 --> 12:25.120
It's just something that some people
take at clubs to, you know, loosen up.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.705
You take this?

12:26.788 --> 12:29.883
A gay man who hates dancing
lives in a sad and lonely little world.

12:29.958 --> 12:33.633
This just melts your inhibitions,
and- and you can dance all night.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.884
- Plus, it gives you a raging-
- I don't wanna-

12:36.005 --> 12:39.009
I don't like this at all. Just
hold on to it, just in case.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.594
Keep it. It's fine.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.350
Jay, I'm gonna
show you something.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.022
A farmer in New Zealand
taught a pig to dance.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.601
Whoa.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.903
See how he keeps
his snout up?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.527
Oh, yeah. This is it.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.200
This is what?

13:01.239 --> 13:03.162
This.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.162
I- I can't do this.
I can't get out of the car.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.122
I'm sorry.
I'm too embarrassed.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.170
Would you just tell me
what's going on? Okay.

13:11.249 --> 13:15.675
I- I- I want you to go read
what's carved on that tree.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.302
Mom, you're freaking me out.
Just do it.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.884
Do it, Haley.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.659
Have fun getting home!

13:41.738 --> 13:43.832
There's your obstacle!

13:43.906 --> 13:45.032
What?

13:45.116 --> 13:47.164
Are you kidding me?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.341
Oh! Son of a ... biscuit!

13:57.420 --> 14:00.515
Why does that keep happening?
Maybe I need a nail gun.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.888
Okay, that's it.
I'm out.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.345
What do you mean, you're out?
Where are you going?

14:05.428 --> 14:08.557
Dad, no offense, but I've
seen you with a glue gun.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.392
I think a nail is gonna be
harder to get out of my hair.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.355
No, don't go.
I'm doing this for you.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.862
Are you, Dad? Are you?

14:17.940 --> 14:20.443
The kid made me
think with that one.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.279
Who was I really
doing this for?

14:23.363 --> 14:26.412
Sometimes I just say,
"Are you, Dad? Are you?"

14:26.491 --> 14:30.462
Because he gets real quiet and
doesn't notice when I walk away.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.051
It's weird, because I feel so
comfortable around you already.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.628
You know, last night,
when I got home,

14:38.711 --> 14:40.338
I just started thinking ...

14:40.421 --> 14:43.095
about all of the fun things
that we could do together.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.218
You know?
Yeah.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.555
I don't wanna scare you off, but my sister's
getting married in a couple of weeks,

14:48.638 --> 14:51.437
and I so don't wanna go
to that thing alone.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.018
Maybe you could be my date.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.526
Katie, you're an amazing woman.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.734
You're smart, you're beautiful,
and how fun is that handbag?

15:02.318 --> 15:05.743
This is gonna come
as a little bit of a shock.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.325
I'm fairly gay.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.914
Don't know why I said that.
I'm- I'm totally gay.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.668
Just gay.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.594
You're telling me you're gay?
Yeah.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.213
Why? I was born that way.
You know, it's just-

15:22.296 --> 15:24.014
No, why are you telling me?

15:24.090 --> 15:27.014
I mean, I know you're gay.
it's obvious.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.355
Well, it's not that- it's not that obvious.
It's- Oh, yeah.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.105
The way you talk and walk and dress
and your theatrical hand gestures.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.810
I do not have
theatrical hand gestures.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.648
Okay, maybe I am
moderately expressive.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.279
But why would you
give me your number?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.326
Oh, because
I want a gay friend.

15:44.402 --> 15:49.033
Someone I can dish with, give me
guy advice and I can shop with.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.413
Those are totally
offensive stereotypes.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.586
We could go see Julia
Roberts movies together.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.834
I know her, and she's as nice
as she seems on screen.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.127
Shut up. Really?
She is, yeah.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.458
Is she?

15:58.541 --> 16:02.671
So you were pretending to be
straight and hitting on me?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.763
It's just a stupid bar bet.
What-

16:04.839 --> 16:07.638
My
boyfriend- Oh, he's here.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.470
Bet me that I couldn't get
a beautiful woman's number.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.976
And as a proud gay man,
I know it shouldn't matter,

16:13.097 --> 16:18.149
but I- I just wish everyone
could find me attractive. Ohh.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.355
Now he's going to get to gloat.
I guess I deserve it.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.492
Hi.  Hi.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.410
How's- How's it going?

16:26.527 --> 16:28.074
Hello.
This is Katie.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.498
And it turns out,
uh, well-

16:30.573 --> 16:34.373
No, actually,
it doesn't turn out well.

16:34.452 --> 16:38.832
Because I thought I finally
met a nice, funny guy ...

16:38.915 --> 16:40.883
who is also hot!

16:40.958 --> 16:43.507
And now he's
telling me he's gay?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.759
He's like
the least gay person ...

16:45.838 --> 16:48.261
I have ever met
in my entire life!

16:48.341 --> 16:51.345
And I thought
he was the one!

16:51.427 --> 16:54.727
And I even told
my mom about him!

16:54.805 --> 16:56.773
You better cherish him!

17:04.022 --> 17:06.776
Hello. Wow.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.332
Are you sure you're gay? No.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.909
- Cam.
- Yes.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.207
Yes.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.130
Look, you're gonna
find somebody ...

17:20.205 --> 17:21.752
because you're
an amazing girl, Katie.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.925
You're the whole package.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.425
I just prefer somebody
who has one.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.799
Okay.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.482
Oh, my God.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.437
That was a lot of girl tongue.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.772
I think I need
a drink-a-doodle-doo.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.827
What was that?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.996
Hello, Haley.
How was your day?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.620
I had no money,
no cell phone-

17:54.699 --> 17:55.951
You're welcome.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.998
What?
I listened to you.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.547
I stopped coddling you.
And look. You overcame an obstacle.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.420
Oh, yeah, I did.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.797
I grew up normal
despite my crazy mom!

18:05.876 --> 18:07.844
Well, that sounds like the
beginning of a great essay.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.422
"Dear college"-

18:09.505 --> 18:11.724
Oh, honey, if you get stuck,
let me know,

18:11.799 --> 18:13.301
and I'll make you
sleep out in the yard.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.728
- You're psychotic!
- Use spell check.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.556
Salsa ]

18:21.017 --> 18:22.519
Whoo!

18:23.394 --> 18:25.442
Aaah!

18:25.521 --> 18:27.944
Don't just sit there!
Get out here!

18:28.024 --> 18:31.324
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Okay.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.121
Â¡Hola! You're looking so good.
How long has it been?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.994
We don't know each other.
Go away.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.916
Fair enough.

18:37.992 --> 18:41.542
Â¡Hola! You're looking so good.
How long has it been?

18:42.872 --> 18:44.590
What was wrong
with that guy?

18:44.665 --> 18:46.383
I would've danced with him.
He's got nice shoulders.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.803
Oh, you know, salsa is
so intimate and sensual ...

18:48.878 --> 18:52.223
that it feels wrong to do it with
somebody else that is not Jay.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.762
Aw. Yeah, Darlene
feels the same way.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.764
If I wasn't here, she'd
be holding up the wall.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.221
Yeah. A wall of men.

18:58.304 --> 19:01.478
You know, I think I should go
home to my loving husband ...

19:01.557 --> 19:04.982
and pull him close and tell him
that I danced with 20 men.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.730
He's not home.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.032
He's in a dicey neighborhood,
worried about his car.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.576
Â¡Ay, no!

19:12.652 --> 19:14.029
Jay, you-

19:14.153 --> 19:16.121
Mwah! What, are we
gonna kiss or dance?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.491
Let's dance. Come, come.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.669
I'm dead set against drugs.
Just say no and all that stuff.

19:21.744 --> 19:25.920
But I thought-
just this once, for Gloria.

19:28.209 --> 19:31.930
And if I was gonna make a complete ass
of myself, I didn't wanna remember it.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.927
The big drug I gave him-
baby aspirin.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.604
Orange flavored.
He could have chewed it.

19:43.641 --> 19:46.110
How come you never
surprise me like that?

19:46.227 --> 19:49.527
I do surprise you. No, you don't.
You never surprise me.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.033
That's gonna be
a hell of a tree house.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.211
Oh. Thanks.
I'm trying.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.538
It's for my son,
but he's kind of lost interest.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.373
It's kind of like my daughter
with the dog,

20:07.456 --> 20:08.548
which is why
I'm the one ...

20:08.624 --> 20:09.625
out here doing this.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.212
Did you just move in?

20:12.294 --> 20:14.638
Lived here eight years.
You?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.307
Twelve.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.384
- Huh.
- Huh.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.516
Me and my friends, we built a
tree house when I was a kid.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.939
We spent hours in that thing.
Loved it.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.732
Me too.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.810
You need any help?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.024
Yes. A lot.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.198
But I- I don't
wanna bother you.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.117
Only thing bothering me is that
drunken Amish roof you got up there.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.739
- Do you even have a level?
- I did.

20:36.819 --> 20:40.198
But I might've gotten frustrated
and thrown it into your yard.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.166
Let me find it. I'll be right over.
Thanks.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.994
I'm Phil, by the way.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.375
I'm Andre.
Nice to meet you, Phil.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.423
Nice to meet you, Andre.

20:49.498 --> 20:54.095
So I guess I was wrong when I said once
you get older, it's harder to make new friends.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.013
Honey, the dude
in the tree is cool!

20:56.088 --> 20:59.308
Andre, it turns out,
is an orthopedic surgeon,

20:59.383 --> 21:02.808
handy with tools
and a great guy to hang out with.

21:02.887 --> 21:06.687
Plus, he's a bad-ass black man
that gives me extra street cred.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.235
That's his joke.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.733
He's my brotha
from a different motha.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.323
What was that?
Different-

21:14.440 --> 21:15.783
That's not it.
What is it?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.948
It's brotha from anotha motha.
Brotha from anotha motha.
