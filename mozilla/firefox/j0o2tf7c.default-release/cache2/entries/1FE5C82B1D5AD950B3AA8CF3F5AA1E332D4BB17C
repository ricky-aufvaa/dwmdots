00:02.878 --> 00:04.471
Did you see it?

00:04.546 --> 00:05.798
Does she know?

00:05.881 --> 00:08.475
This is the last thing
she needs today.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.177
No!

00:10.302 --> 00:12.976
Busy day at the Dunphy compound. We have
a wedding tonight, and this afternoon,

00:13.055 --> 00:15.979
Claire is debating Duane Bailey
in the race for town council.

00:16.058 --> 00:20.279
And now the Weekly Saver says
that some voters find Claire,

00:20.354 --> 00:23.654
quote, "Angry and unlikable."

00:23.732 --> 00:26.986
To those voters I say,
wait till she sees this.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.822
No one can mention it
to her.

00:29.905 --> 00:33.500
We can't have some unscientific
poll shaking Claire's confidence.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.373
Phil. What poll?

00:35.452 --> 00:36.954
Too late.
She knows.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.711
- Who told her?
- What is this, a witch hunt?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.758
Oh, my God.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.551
I have to go.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.880
Well, I just don't think
it's a big deal.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.840
I mean, how many people
read the Weekly-

00:47.965 --> 00:49.808
Saver?
Saver anyway?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.931
22,000-ish.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.350
My company advert-

00:54.429 --> 00:57.148
used to advertise
with that newspaper.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.898
And how am I angry and unlikable?

00:59.977 --> 01:01.149
Can I take this one?

01:01.228 --> 01:03.026
I wouldn't.
You seem angry now.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.732
I am angry- at that poll.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.409
I think it's the yelling.
I would tone down the yelling.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.111
Honey, I don't yell
for no reason.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.663
You yelled at my teacher
for calling me special.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.832
Honey, that was not
a compliment.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.001
Sweetheart,
you're not unlikable.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.168
Thank you.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.372
You just seem unlikable.
But if we work on it,

01:19.454 --> 01:21.172
it's totally fixable.
How? How?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.921
Phil, how are we gonna
work on it?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.918
First of all, lose the
snippy attitude. Mm-hmm.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.879
Then, I don't know, maybe
we could have a mock debate.

01:26.962 --> 01:29.761
Oh, good idea. That way Morn can
rehearse her views on the issues.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.593
Yeah, and we can point out all the little
things she does that turn people off.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.304
Like that look.
I would lose that look.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.267
Spooky, but better.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.020
# Hey, hey #

01:43.103 --> 01:45.105
# Hey, hey #

01:45.188 --> 01:47.236
# Hey, hey #

01:47.316 --> 01:49.159
# Hey, hey #

01:49.234 --> 01:50.406
# Hey ##

01:52.821 --> 01:54.869
All right.
Thank you very much.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.792
Hey, Lily.
Come here, honey.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.246
Hi. Do you know what this is?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.247
A box.
Containing?

02:02.372 --> 02:05.751
She doesn't know "containing." Well, that's
how she learns new words- by us using them.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.714
Or that's how we lower her self-esteem- by
bombarding her with confusing vocabulary.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.594
What's the box containing?

02:11.673 --> 02:14.392
Told you.
Okay. it's your dress.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.687
It's finally here.
Ah!

02:16.762 --> 02:19.982
It's every little girl's dream
to be a flower girl in a wedding.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.775
It's Lily's chance to shine.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.898
I was a three-time
ring bearer.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.480
It's Lily's chance to shine.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.449
Oh!

02:29.524 --> 02:30.821
Pretty.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.198
Oh, no. Cam, Cam.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.664
She's gonna look like Little Bo Peep.
Or Little Bo Cheap.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.582
Look at this fabric.
It's already pilling.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.126
Maybe it'll look better on.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.124
You mean ... turned on?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.542
No, it does not. Cam!
Oh!

02:43.622 --> 02:45.624
- I love it!
- No, you don't.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.085
Oh, my gosh. Are we really
gonna let her wear this?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.296
You know what? If the bride
wants to have a tacky wedding,

02:50.379 --> 02:51.631
she can have a tacky wedding.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.302
Lily will be the bright spot.
Literally.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.055
Heard it as soon as
I said it.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.682
Stella!

02:58.929 --> 03:01.102
Where's my good girl?

03:02.808 --> 03:04.606
Gloria, is Stella up there?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.938
No. But I am.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.739
Why don't you say hello
to your wife when you come home?

03:09.815 --> 03:12.659
Well, why don't you greet me
at the door, wagging your tail?

03:12.734 --> 03:15.283
Stella, honey, where are you?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.363
Stella!

03:18.281 --> 03:19.908
My baby!

03:19.991 --> 03:22.414
Stella, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.918
Okay? You okay?

03:30.001 --> 03:32.754
Why are you
swimming in your clothes?

03:32.838 --> 03:36.308
Because I'm self-conscious about my body.
Stella fell in the pool.

03:36.383 --> 03:40.138
It's my fault. I let her out, and
then I got caught up in my couponing.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.269
Any coupons for swim lessons?
'Cause Stella needs some.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.852
Seriously. Manny you teach to
swim by throwing him in the pool,

03:46.935 --> 03:49.313
but the dog
gets swimming lessons?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.990
I gotta say, it was
unpleasant but effective.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.409
We have to teach Stella how to
swim, otherwise she could drown.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.737
Why don't you teach her
not to jump in the pool?

03:56.820 --> 03:58.788
She didn't jump in the pool.
She fell in the pool.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.834
Why suddenly would she jump in the pool
when she doesn't know how to swim?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.956
Why does she bark at the vacuum?

04:04.035 --> 04:06.538
It's a thing. it's never
going to play with you.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.715
Are you saying
that Stella is stupid?

04:08.832 --> 04:11.881
Are you covering her ears? Let's
have a little compassion.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.804
She's probably still traumatized
from her near-death experience.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.678
Again? What's happening?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.760
Â¡Ay, no!

04:19.885 --> 04:23.480
Welcome, candidates. Mrs. Dunphy.
Thank you for having me.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.058
- And Councilman Bailey.
- Gosh, thank you so much, Alex.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.769
I'm deeply honored to be here,
and I remain, as ever,

04:28.852 --> 04:31.822
a humble servant to the greatest
little town in the greatest darn-

04:31.897 --> 04:34.275
Eye rolling.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.075
Playful eye rolling.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.280
Uh, how do we, as voters, know it's playful?
I would avoid it.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.078
Okay. No eye rolling.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.376
And don't purse your lips like that.
It makes you look annoyed.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.498
Mm-hmm.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.464
And don't touch your face. Yeah,
no face touching. Seems nervous.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.007
Some of this is subjective.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.836
What? What now? Finger.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.047
It looks like you're scolding us.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.802
I will keep my hands
at my sides.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.051
Not on your hips. You're not Superman.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.018
Can we get started?
We haven't started?

05:02.093 --> 05:04.892
- I've prepared some questions.
- Oh, goody. Actual questions.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.766
Honk. Sarcasm.
Just go.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.524
Okay, Mrs. Dunphy, why are you
running for local office?

05:11.603 --> 05:13.446
Okay, that's, um-
that's good.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.490
L, um-

05:15.565 --> 05:18.489
Mom, you really shouldn't stutter
over a basic question like that.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.320
You should at least
know why you're running.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.405
I thought the moderator
was supposed to be objective.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.663
Not if she's the only one in the room
who has actual debate experience.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.212
- Now, why are you running?
- I saw the need for a stop sign-

05:29.329 --> 05:31.127
Liar!
Phil.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.959
I just think you should
be ready for anything.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.802
I saw the need for a-

05:35.877 --> 05:38.255
- What?
- Sorry. Accidental buzz.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.306
I saw the need for a stop
sign in my neighborhood,

05:40.382 --> 05:42.430
and although I collected
the necessary signatures ...

05:42.509 --> 05:44.637
and did the paperwork, I found local
government to be entirely unhelpful.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.897
What?
Too long. I'm bored.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.396
Yeah, next question.
I feel like I'm in school.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.066
Some say the political system
is bogged down ...

05:54.187 --> 05:57.612
by ideological hard-liners unwilling
to compromise. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.991
How would you respond to that,
Councilman Bailey?

06:01.069 --> 06:04.323
I would like to use
my lifeline.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.829
I'll take this.
If elected,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.831
I would consider
all perspectives,

06:08.910 --> 06:11.538
and I would not ignore
opposing viewpoints.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.625
Helicopter. Just keep going.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.961
I would consider all
perspectives, and I wouldn't-

06:17.043 --> 06:18.590
- You suck!
- Luke!

06:18.670 --> 06:21.093
- You have to be ready for hecklers.
- He's right.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.675
Mmm. Okay, I'm doing over.
No buzzing.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.510
If elected, I-

06:27.012 --> 06:28.355
What?
Too close to the mike.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.020
Phil, it's a hairbrush.
Okay.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.234
If elected, I would
consider all opinions ...

06:36.313 --> 06:38.236
and not ignore those
of the opposition,

06:38.315 --> 06:40.943
as Councilman Bailey
has done for six terms.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.035
What? That
was a great answer.

06:43.111 --> 06:47.491
Well, I couldn't hear it because you were
showing me the bad side of your face, so-

06:47.616 --> 06:49.710
I have a bad side?
Yeah, the left.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.832
- No, it's the right.
- Dad, it's totally the left.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.882
- I mean, look at it.
- Sweetheart, why do you think I chose my side of the bed?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.549
Okay, okay. Thank you.
Thank you, family.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.218
This has been
super-duper helpful.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.011
Hands, lips, sarcasm,

07:00.086 --> 07:01.713
eye rolling,
wrong side of the face.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.682
Oh, yeah. Now I see it.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.260
Yeah.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.938
She's ready.

07:10.138 --> 07:14.894
And it's this, and it's this.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.025
Not this, but this.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.822
Okay.
Okay, that's good, Cam.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.242
Save- Save some petals
for Lily, all right?

07:22.359 --> 07:24.111
Let's do it over here, sweetheart.
Try, honey. Okay.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.704
There you go. Like you're coming
down the aisle! Yeah, yeah.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.327
Okay.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.579
Not too many at once.
You're doing great, Lil.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.623
Oh, she is, isn't she?
Forget the bride.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.545
All the eyes
are gonna be on her.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.419
Oh-

07:49.928 --> 07:52.477
I cannot believe you laughed!
I am sorry.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.771
children cursing and old people rapping.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.611
Cam, we have to tell her
it's a bad word. No.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.406
That just gives it more power.
The less we make of it, the better.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.358
Let's just pretend
like it never happened.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.193
Okay, well, maybe it-
maybe it didn't.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.320
Maybe we- Maybe we misheard.
Yeah.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.281
Maybe she said "truck" ...

08:09.364 --> 08:10.741
or- or "duck."

08:10.824 --> 08:13.543
Or "luck."
She could've said "yuck."

08:13.618 --> 08:15.495
Daddy, can I have
some ice cream?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.956
No, honey, if you're hungry,
you can have some fruit.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.542
Fruit-

08:20.625 --> 08:22.502
Oh, God!

08:22.585 --> 08:25.259
I have two children.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.563
Phil. Phil,
is this televised?

08:33.638 --> 08:36.015
I didn't tell you because I
didn't want to make you nervous.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.977
Great plan. Really. Good plan, throwing
me for a curveball at the last minute.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.150
Mom, chill. It's just public access.
Mm-hmm.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.529
My debate team's on public access, and the
only people who watch me are you guys.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.778
Yep, all the time.
So maybe nobody'll see this?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.489
No, we want people to see this.
That's how you win elections.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.119
That's the whole point.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.828
Then Mom should do something
so crazy and stupid it goes viral.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.960
- Mom, please don't go viral.
- Okay, I'll add that to my list of things not to do.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.168
Don't touch my face,
don't roll my eyes,

09:02.250 --> 09:05.094
don't point my fingers,
and definitely don't go viral.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.888
Do any of you
still believe in me?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.886
Of course we do.
We're on your side.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.218
The right side,
not the left.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.144
Let's grab a seat.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.892
Here we go.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.316
- Right. Not left.
- Okay. Mom, just be confident.

09:18.391 --> 09:22.441
Based on what? I just lost a debate in my
living room, and people think I'm unlikable.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.740
That's just the word men use for powerful
women because they feel threatened.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.570
So just forget everything else
and be proud and powerful.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.781
- How did you get so smart?
- I've always assumed adoption or baby switch.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.162
- Mmm.
- Hey, hey. No kisses.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.743
- Proud and powerful.
- Sorry.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.917
And no apologizing. Yes.
Shut up and get in there.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.506
That's more like it.
Uh-huh.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.751
Yeah.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.426
Oh, God.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.889
- There she is. Go get 'em, Claire.
- Hi. Thanks.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.513
Don't worry, we're going to cheer
for you, no matter what you say.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.391
Oh, good. More support
from my loving family.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.690
Honk. Sarcasm.
Why'd you bring Stella?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.938
She keeps getting out
and jumping in the pool.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.190
We don't want to take any
chances, because she can't swim.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.271
Then why does she keep
jumping in the pool?

10:05.355 --> 10:08.484
I've been thinking about it. I got a theory.
She might be suicidal.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.489
What? That's crazy.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.822
There's "not" such thing
as doggy suicide.

10:13.905 --> 10:17.876
Hi. Duane Bailey. Uh, sorry. I
couldn't help but overhear.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.669
In addition to being
a public servant,

10:19.744 --> 10:22.497
I'm also an award-winning
breeder of Puggles.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.753
I won the Puggly- twice.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.962
And I'm afraid that doggy
suicide is all too real.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.718
It's just the mainstream media
doesn't report on it ...

10:30.797 --> 10:33.300
'cause it's not as sexy
as feline AIDS.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.136
Stella is not suicidal.
She's just stupid.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.187
Well, that might be
part of your problem.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.773
She senses you don't like her.
You have no idea.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.773
This one's been against this little
angel from the very beginning.

10:43.852 --> 10:47.152
Yeah, well, dogs pick up on that.
You know, they're very sensitive.

10:47.230 --> 10:51.076
I like to call them, um-
bottomless pits of need.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.404
But not to their face though.
That would just destroy them.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.080
- Not you.
- So now this is my fault?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.625
I think he knows what he's talking about.
The man won a Puggly.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.334
Two. I won two-
We're done here.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.670
In two thousand-
Yeah.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.464
Do you have any idea
what station this is on?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.167
Oh, here, I'll look online.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.969
It's a webcast? That would have been
helpful to know 900 channels ago.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.842
No, it's on public access
or something.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.719
I want to watch Aunt Claire.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.017
Okay. Well, first, honey, we
need to talk about something.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.935
It's about that word
you said this morning.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.106
- What word?
- You know, the one that starts with

11:21.181 --> 11:23.980
Flower?
No.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.605
Fruit?
No.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.608
If she doesn't remember it,
we shouldn't remind her.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.564
Oh, well, she said it
three times.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.194
Oh, you mean-

11:31.274 --> 11:33.948
Cam, leave the room.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.827
No. I can do this.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.375
- Lily, that is a bad word.
- Bad word.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.748
And you are not allowed
to say it ever.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.831
- But it makes you laugh.
- Okay, well, Daddy shouldn't be laughing,

11:45.914 --> 11:48.167
and you should never
say that word.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.344
- Do you understand?
- Maybe.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.763
Okay, this is not a game,
all right?

11:53.880 --> 11:57.180
If you say that word one more time, I'm
gonna take away all your toys. I'm serious.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.179
She knows I'm not serious.
What about the wedding?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.855
What if she says it there?
She's like a ticking time bomb.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.775
- What are we gonna do? Cancel?
- Yes. Maybe we just call and say ...

12:05.850 --> 12:08.228
we're not going to any more weddings
until the gays can get married.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.904
Oh, so now we're political.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.324
We leave town on gay pride weekend
because we don't like the traffic.

12:17.445 --> 12:22.497
But there's no substitute
for experience.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.203
For example, I doubt
my opponent is familiar with ...

12:25.286 --> 12:27.709
town ordinance 26-12B.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.338
26-12B has to do
with noise pollution,

12:30.416 --> 12:32.885
something, sir, that
you are guilty of right now.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.889
Oh, no, she didn't!
Go, Mom!

12:36.965 --> 12:38.717
- Ladies and gentlemen-
- Look at her eyes.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.304
I know. They're a little too close together.
It's been bugging me for years.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.685
No. She's in the zone.
She's ready for anything.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.358
I do like to talk-
about the issues.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.859
Uh, speaking of issues, your
husband seems to have some. Hmm.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.281
I'm sorry?

12:53.356 --> 12:55.279
Am not sorry.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.860
- What?
- Oh.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.992
Well, I wouldn't want to bring
it up, but since you ask, um,

13:00.071 --> 13:01.948
in February of last year,
your husband,

13:02.031 --> 13:04.204
one, uh, Phillip Dunphy,

13:04.284 --> 13:06.412
was questioned
at a local hotel ...

13:06.494 --> 13:09.418
for lewd
and lascivious conduct.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.840
Oh, geez.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.836
That's not true. Ma'am, according
to this police report,

13:13.918 --> 13:16.717
he, uh, broke into
a stranger's room,

13:16.796 --> 13:21.142
stripped naked and then posed
provocatively on the bed.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.306
That is technically true.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.393
But in all fairness,
it was Valentine's Day.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.024
Oh, oh. I'm- I'm so sorry.
It was Valentine's Day.

13:32.103 --> 13:36.859
I'm not sure if your husband was born in
this country- perhaps he snuck in illegally-

13:36.941 --> 13:40.616
but here in America, we celebrate
Valentines Day with chocolates,

13:40.695 --> 13:42.868
not our private parts.
Mmm.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.706
This is my new favorite show.
Shh!

13:47.785 --> 13:50.459
No, sir. He was looking
for me, his wife,

13:50.538 --> 13:52.415
and he walked into
the wrong room.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.297
If you believe that, I have some
talking Puggles I'd like to sell you.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.845
Do you believe this?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.797
Talking dogs?
I'm skeptical.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.009
I won the Puggly- twice.
Be strong.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.766
I am glad that my opponent
brought this up,

14:05.845 --> 14:10.646
as I feel that it speaks to
his character more than mine.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.569
I think that we should raise
the level of discourse ...

14:13.644 --> 14:16.147
and get back to the issues that
the voters really care about.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.779
When he was naked,
what were you wearing?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.860
I don't think
that's relevant.

14:20.943 --> 14:26.495
- Are you sex freaks?
- My personal life has nothing to do with this.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.167
Uh-

14:28.242 --> 14:30.244
My opponent
has brought this up ...

14:30.328 --> 14:32.672
to distract
from his own record,

14:32.747 --> 14:34.920
which shows that
in- in six years,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.673
he has achieved nothing more
than writing one ordinance ...

14:37.752 --> 14:41.006
that allows private parties
to have more than eight dogs.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.138
- Hmm. Hmm. - it's like
watching the Hindenburg.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.265
It's the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.480
Excuse me.
Stand by.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.353
I am Phil Dunphy,
and I am not a pervert.

14:51.432 --> 14:56.063
I, like a lot of men
in this town,

14:56.145 --> 14:58.113
enjoy making love
to my wife.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.284
I mean, uh-
I mean with their wives.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.533
Not me. Them.

15:04.612 --> 15:08.742
Look. I should probably just sit down
and say nothing, but it's too late.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.374
I am standing,
and I'm obviously talking,

15:11.452 --> 15:14.547
and now you're looking at me, and
I feel the need to keep going.

15:14.664 --> 15:19.761
First of
all, no charges were filed.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.965
Everyone had a good laugh-
about the situation.

15:23.047 --> 15:26.096
Not- Not about me.
Everything's fine down there.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.802
Anyhoo.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.225
Where were we?

15:30.304 --> 15:32.398
All over YouTube.

15:32.515 --> 15:36.315
We went viral.
Some sick bastard Auto-Tuned me.

15:36.394 --> 15:39.614
# I, like a lot of men in this town #

15:39.689 --> 15:42.784
# I enhoy making love
to my wife- wife #

15:44.277 --> 15:45.950
# And I don't know how to stop #

15:48.030 --> 15:50.032
# I am a pervert
Pervert
Per- #

15:51.492 --> 15:55.417
Jay, Manny, we should have
been there already.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.919
Gloria, I'm tying my tie!

15:57.999 --> 16:00.001
I'm accessorizing.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.462
And I thought I was the woman.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.764
The door!

16:08.843 --> 16:11.221
Â¡Ay!
Stella, no, no!

16:11.304 --> 16:13.682
Â¡Ay, no, no!
Stella, don't do it.

16:13.764 --> 16:18.144
Don't kill yourself. You are a
perfectly fine dog. I don't hate you.

16:18.227 --> 16:22.107
Stella, okay, I was a little mean to you,
but that's no reason to kill yourself.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.070
You are young. You still
have so much left to smell.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.199
Â¡Ay!

16:27.320 --> 16:30.164
I-I go! I'm coming!

16:30.239 --> 16:32.287
I'm- Manny!

16:32.366 --> 16:34.744
Â¡Ay! Come on, Stella!

16:36.162 --> 16:37.664
What happened?
Are you okay?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.499
She did it again.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.459
And you jumped in
to save her.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.796
No, Jay. I wanted to take a little
swim before going to the wedding.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.973
Get her a towel.
She's shaking like a leaf.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.102
Oh, no, no.
I meant- I meant-

16:55.181 --> 16:58.526
Thank you, Jay.
The dog towel for me.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.070
For the wife.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.109
- Hi.
- Hey, guys. Hi.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.737
Hi. Hey, what's shakin'?
What's cookin'?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.787
You saw the debate,
didn't you?

17:10.905 --> 17:12.281
The de-what?
No, that wasn't-

17:12.406 --> 17:14.784
Was that on today? That was today.
Oh, I didn't remember.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.618
You are the worst liars.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.249
It was phenomenal television.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.751
Oh, Lily.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.503
What a ... dress.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.632
Oh, well.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.472
How 'bout there?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.676
- Wow.
- Yikes.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.261
- She looks like a Lite-Brite.
- Luke, honey.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.312
Lily, sweetie, are you
excited to be a flower girl?

17:35.388 --> 17:38.312
Yeah?
You a little bit nervous?

17:38.391 --> 17:39.984
Yeah?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.482
Why isn't she talking to me?
Did she see the debate too?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.690
Nope, she's on verbal lockdown.
Oh.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.070
She's been dropping
a certain curse word all day.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.278
Yeah. Yeah, so we're just hoping the next
one doesn't happen during the wedding.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.740
If it does, it'll be the second most embarrassing
thing to happen to our family today.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.700
Phil, you said
it wasn't that bad.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.420
That was in the car. We're
in a church now. Honey.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.998
Somebody turn her off.
I think I'm having a seizure.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.833
Oh, buddy. Oh. Yeah.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.338
Oh, good. I thought that we
were going to miss Lily.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.174
Ships at sea wouldn't miss Lily.
Where have you guys been?

18:11.257 --> 18:14.227
I had to jump in the pool
to save that stupid dog.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.845
Who she loves.
Ay-

18:15.928 --> 18:18.772
That I didn't let her drown
doesn't mean that I love her.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.728
I barely got Manny back in the
pool after that possum incident.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.155
I thought it drowned, but turns
out it was just playing possum.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.948
Yes, papi.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.711
Good job.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.677
You know what the
worst part of today was?

18:51.756 --> 18:53.429
I imagine
it's hard to choose.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.100
When everything
was melting down,

18:55.176 --> 18:58.851
I realized I had an answer to
your question- why I was running.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.809
I wanted to make my family proud,
and I did the exact opposite.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.982
No. No, I did. I totally
embarrassed you.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.565
No. No, Dad
embarrassed me.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.616
I was proud of you.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.614
I think it's cool you're
running for local office.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.288
I mean, it's totally nerdy,
and that's kind of my thing.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.617
Mmm. Maybe
it's kind of our thing.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.754
Someday I'll
walk you down the aisle.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.930
If you're not in perv jail.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.018
Please be seated.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.936
Friends, family,
thank you for-

19:43.057 --> 19:46.436
Really? Well, you know
I cry at weddings.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.237
Oh, no. What?

19:48.354 --> 19:51.733
Stop. Stop crying. Just because you have
ice water in your veins doesn't mean-

19:51.816 --> 19:53.489
No, no, Lily.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.240
No, Lily.
He's fine.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.080
Daddy's not sad.
Daddy, Daddy.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.053
See? I told you it was funny.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.651
There, that oughta do it.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.484
Go on, you little motorboat.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.911
Ah, look at her go.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.580
Where's she goin'? Ah, geez.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.908
I think she's tryin' to get
herself sucked into the filter.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.493
What'd you say to her?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.203
I didn't say anything.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.879
Wait a second.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.376
Jay, look!

20:48.497 --> 20:50.044
See?

20:50.124 --> 20:52.377
She was not trying
to kill herself.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.304
