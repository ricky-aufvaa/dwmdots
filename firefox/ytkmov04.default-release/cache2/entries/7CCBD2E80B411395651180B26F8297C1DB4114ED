WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.465
Ay, finally!

00:05.547 --> 00:08.346
Look who's wearing
her itsy-bitsy bikini.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.473
He can comment
because he's gay.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.722
He was talking about Lily.
So was I.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.478
Ay, Cam,
you make her look so pretty.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.059
Guess who's not coming
for Christmas.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.019
And the spotlight shifts. Mom.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.524
- She canceled.
- What?

00:20.646 --> 00:22.273
In a voice mail, no less.
Unbelievable.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.108
And by that,
I mean believable.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.864
Why isn't Nana coming?
I don't know.

00:25.943 --> 00:29.117
Something about her new boyfriend
whisking her away on a cruise.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.616
I just got my gift. What boyfriend?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.245
Carl, the cruise ship captain.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.161
It was in her
holiday newsletter.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.838
Oh, I can't read
that whole thing. No.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.836
Yeah, after two pages
about the bird she rescued?

00:39.915 --> 00:42.794
And by the way, I don't think you can
say you rescued something if it dies.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.421
It died? She wrote
a poem about it.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.506
A little too free with
the free verse for my taste.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.057
But fine,
we'll call it a poem.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.056
I stopped reading after she
talked about suing her book club.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.560
Oh, I stopped reading after "Dear
friends, family and others."

00:55.639 --> 00:57.186
I'm sorry. Who are "others"?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.309
Me.  No, you're not-

00:59.393 --> 01:01.395
Uh, maybe you are.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.446
Actually, she's kind of
at her best at Christmas.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.024
She makes a mean cookie.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.530
What other kind could
she possibly make? Come on.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.580
A y, it's so sad that you guys are not
gonna be with your mom this Christmas.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.244
It's fine. Yeah,
it's more than fine.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.914
Let's just- Can we move off of Mom?
Yes, please.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.495
Yeah, and the upside now,
Mitchell,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.080
we can spend Christmas
in Missouri,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.415
where it actually feels
like Christmas.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.375
Wait, hang on a second.
Just because Mom isn't coming ...

01:23.458 --> 01:26.086
doesn't mean we're not gonna
spend Christmas together.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.716
I mean, it's about family.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.764
Who do you think we're seeing
in Missouri? The Oak Ridge Boys?

01:29.840 --> 01:32.343
Hold on. I thought we were all gettin'
together Christmas Eve this year.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.269
We're on a flight to Mexico
the 25th.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.688
What do you mean, you're getting
on a flight on the 25th?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.265
You two needed time
with your morn.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.271
I've already served my time
with your mom.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.274
- Oh, Dad.
- Well, when are we gonna have Christmas, then?

01:43.395 --> 01:46.615
I heard kids are getting
snatched in Mexico. What?

01:46.690 --> 01:48.613
Kids get snatched here
just as much.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.285
It happens all the time.
Don't be scared.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.283
And when you say
"all the time"-

01:52.362 --> 01:53.864
Okay, well, what about
next weekend?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.449
'Cause we don't leave
till the 21st, right?

01:55.532 --> 01:57.626
Yeah, we leave tomorrow. We
don't come back until the 21st.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.170
Hey, math club, could you
get me some more lemonade?

02:00.245 --> 02:03.294
Are we saying that this is the last time we're
all going to be together as a family ...

02:03.373 --> 02:04.875
until after the holidays?

02:04.958 --> 02:06.881
And for you, maybe ever.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.633
- Well, this stinks.
- Yeah. We can't do this!

02:08.711 --> 02:10.634
- We always spend Christmas together.
- Who dreamed this up?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.307
Yeah, we have
to do something about it.

02:12.382 --> 02:17.058
Ho, ho, hold up a sec.
We're all free today.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.856
We've got four hours to shop,
cook, wrap, get a tree.

02:19.931 --> 02:23.026
By tonight, we could be
celebrating Christmas, right?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.145
I guess we could do that.
Of course we can.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.650
Have you ever heard
of express Christmas?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.900
No. No, you haven't, because
I just invented it.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.780
Express Christmas, T.M.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.495
It's when you can't have it on
Christmas day- Yeah, we got it.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.535
Get on with it. We're wasting time!
We're wasting time!

02:35.614 --> 02:38.868
Everyone in the house! We'll make a plan!
Time is of the-

02:38.950 --> 02:41.829
Ow! Hot! Hot!
That's just too hot!

02:41.912 --> 02:43.459
Oh, Phil!

02:44.122 --> 02:52.177
# Hey, hey #

02:52.255 --> 02:53.427
# Hey ##

02:55.217 --> 02:56.685
So we're really
doin' this, huh?

02:56.760 --> 02:57.852
Yes, Dad. Let's go.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.771
'Cause I had stuff lined
up for Christmas Eve.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.567
Yeah, Jay, it's Manny's last chance
to enjoy a family Christmas.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.110
Until next year,
you mean.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.233
Well,
with all the snatchings-

03:07.312 --> 03:09.064
Get out of my head, Luke.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.533
Okay, who's gonna get the tree?
Oh, Oh, I will, I will.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.952
Because, you know, get the wrong
kind, people get upset.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.946
You get upset.
I'm people.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.123
Fine. I'll get the turkey.
What about gifts?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.450
Jay, did we finish shopping?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.830
Yeah, but
we're not wrapped.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.752
I can help with that. We have
a mobile wrapping station.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.205
God, has that thing
paid for itself.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.789
Really? 'Cause I feel
like I paid for it.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.500
Okay. We've got lights and
ornaments at our place.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.719
Oh, you know what'd be great
is the angel. The angel!

03:30.794 --> 03:31.886
Yeah, where is it'?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.555
Gloria, it's up in your attic.
Would you get it?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.303
A y, no,
not the attic!

03:35.382 --> 03:38.056
It's dirty, and
there are spiders.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.887
Oh, but it really won't
be Christmas without it.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.564
It won't be Christmas with it.
it's December 16.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.437
Luke will help Gloria.
He's not scared.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.644
Oh, good. You won't
find me in any attic.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.527
- That might be exactly where they find you.
- Mom!

03:50.605 --> 03:54.030
Uh, I have a party tonight. You promised
I could go if I got a "B" on my test.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.407
I studied. I read stuff. What
was the point of all that?

03:56.528 --> 03:58.701
The point, young lady,
was- Who can remember?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.908
Express Christmas
will be done by 9:00.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.534
Claire, I'll text you the gift list.
Okay.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.085
You and Haley
do the shopping.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.539
Manny, you're coming with me.
We're gonna get groceries.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.498
Dinner, our house, 6:00.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.175
Let's move!

04:10.250 --> 04:14.551
On Dasher, on Dancer,
on Prancer and Vixen!

04:15.505 --> 04:17.257
Hey, that kind of worked out.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.850
- Jay.
- Come on, Haley.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.969
Jay, you are gonna love this
wrapping- it'll be fun.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.646
A lot of fun.
We can go to Target, okay?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.474
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Let's go!

04:26.808 --> 04:29.527
So it's just me and Lily
getting the tree, then?

04:30.353 --> 04:31.525
Hello?
Hello?

04:32.522 --> 04:35.446
My mom tells me
it's "Xmas" in a text?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.198
Yeah, well, my mom canceled
in a voice mail ...

04:37.277 --> 04:40.952
and told me she had a boyfriend in
a newsletter, so ... join the team.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.453
Put some clothes on.
We're gettin' a tree.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.377
Sweetie, come on.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.878
Luke!
At what?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.584
What do you mean, at what?
I said "Luke."

04:52.667 --> 04:54.715
I am looking.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.297
I know you are.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.926
Stay on the beams.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.508
Maybe it's here.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.516
Ay, dios mio!
El diablo is back!

05:06.181 --> 05:08.525
What is so special
about that angel, anyways?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.102
I don't know.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.654
I guess Nana made it for Morn and
Uncle Mitchell when they were kids.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.107
Ay, that's nice.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.533
0w!

05:16.608 --> 05:19.657
- Look where you're going!
- To open more boxes.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.907
Ay-

05:23.990 --> 05:26.084
Oh, you said, "Look where
you're going," didn't you?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.378
Yes.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.797
Every time you said "Luke,"
I think you're saying "Look."

05:30.914 --> 05:33.713
I don't hear the difference.
it's not that hard.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.918
One is my name.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.548
Juan is not your name!

05:36.628 --> 05:38.630
Stop kidding around
and look, Luke.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.101
Ay, I get it!
"Look" sounds like "Luke."

05:43.176 --> 05:44.928
Yes.
Thank God.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.265
I've been carrying that one
around for three years.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.315
There's, like, a
hundred things on this list.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.738
I know. But it's just the two of us.
it's fun.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.815
Okay, it's not
fake Mother's Day.

05:56.898 --> 06:01.495
Oh, this place is huge!
Oh, plus we have to cook dinner!

06:01.611 --> 06:03.955
This is impossible.
Listen to me.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.286
Your whole life
has led to this moment.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.713
All the training,
the hours of dedication.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.792
There's not a soul alive who can
touch you when it comes to shopping.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.003
And baby, you know it.
Look at me.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.968
Be you.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.517
Give me that list. Never
been more proud in my life.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.095
Come on.
No!

06:28.346 --> 06:30.019
This way.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.566
What about this one?
Let's see.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.568
No, no. I'm sorry. I know I'm
really being O.C.D. right now,

06:37.647 --> 06:40.116
but there's something very
particular that I'm looking for.

06:40.191 --> 06:44.412
It needs to be a Douglas fir at least eight
feet tall and look good from all sides.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.739
Exactly.
No bald spots.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.495
Yes.
Thank you, thank you.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.872
The key is symmetry,
rig ht?

06:49.951 --> 06:53.672
# Oh, symmetfy
Oh, symmetry #

06:53.747 --> 06:55.215
How come we never
go shopping together?

06:55.332 --> 06:56.925
Because I hate shopping.
I do too!

06:57.042 --> 06:58.544
Huh.
Okay, this one.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.674
Wait.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.262
Oh.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.931
I think I know
what you're lookin' for,

07:03.006 --> 07:05.475
and we just got a shipment
that might be perfect for you.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.263
Okay. Wow.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.769
Just because my uncle
is clearly gay ...

07:11.848 --> 07:14.601
doesn't mean he'd ever want
your tacky pink tree.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.028
And frankly, we'd rather throw
some lights on a coat rack ...

07:17.103 --> 07:20.733
than have to deal with knuckle-draggers
like you today of all clays.

07:21.691 --> 07:22.988
December 16.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.038
Okay, first of all,
amazing.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.407
Second of all-
I was pointin' to the truck.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.869
It's full of eight-foot Douglas firs.
it's behind the pink tree.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.875
Yeah. Second of all-

07:33.995 --> 07:37.295
Uh, we're gonna go ahead and-and
take, uh, this- this tree. That one.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.843
And we're going to tie it
onto our car ourselves.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.170
You bet you will.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.805
I have two daddies.
He gets it, Lily.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.881
Yeah.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.596
Oh, finger.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.189
All right. Mmm.
Cam and Jay.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.187
You know, sort of sounds
like a bird.

07:55.266 --> 07:58.361
"The migratory patterns of
the Cam-and-Jay."

07:58.436 --> 08:00.154
Got any more tape
in that thing?

08:00.230 --> 08:01.823
Do I have more tape in that?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.491
I got a tank full of tape,
mister.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.819
What do you want? Invisible?
Satin finish?

08:05.944 --> 08:07.446
Uh, double-sided?
Whatever, whatever.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.076
Okay.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.703
Well, that's interesting. I
doubt that it is, but what?

08:14.786 --> 08:18.632
Well, I mean, the way you wrap a gift.
It's a lot of tape.

08:18.707 --> 08:22.086
Nobody can get in.
Kind of like, you know-

08:23.628 --> 08:27.258
I mean, well, you let me in.
But in general, why-

08:28.049 --> 08:29.551
Why so much tape, Jay?

08:29.634 --> 08:32.011
Why are you wearing a sweater
when it's 95 degrees out?

08:32.095 --> 08:34.018
It's my Christmas sweater.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.191
Based on those stains, you
are the Christmas sweater.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.442
Well, who's
been a very good boy?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.238
Mmm. So-

08:52.073 --> 08:54.542
Okay, are we gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

08:54.617 --> 08:57.040
Which is ironic,
because it's so tiny.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.669
A man doesn't give another
man a gift this small.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.001
Oh, what do you think it is?
A ring?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.174
Uh, was there wine
with this cork?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.055
Yes, there was,
and we drank it on-

09:11.134 --> 09:13.432
Well, we drank it on-
Yeah.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.809
Um, on that boat.

09:16.848 --> 09:17.895
You have no idea.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.022
I can't even remember
my own anniversary, Cam.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.947
How would I have remembered having
had wine with my son's boyfriend?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.945
No, I do this.
This is my fault.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.527
L- I attach too much
meaning to things.

09:28.610 --> 09:32.285
I mean, we watched our first football
game together five years ago,

09:32.363 --> 09:35.367
and I feel the need to save the cork
from the bottle of wine you served.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.667
I mean, who does that?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.245
It's not your only gift,
by the way.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.296
There's a duplicate bottle
in that box right over there,

09:40.371 --> 09:44.717
which I had engraved with the date and the
final score, because I have a problem!

09:44.793 --> 09:46.420
I feel too much!
I gotta get goin' to Claire's.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.177
- Cam-
- No! Fresh wound! Can't talk yet.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.007
Fine.
We'll put a cork in it.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.846
Let it scab, Jay.
Let it scab.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.938
Oh, there you are.
I thought I'd lost you.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.774
Oh, sorry. I may have taken a
few minutes to try out a futon.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.360
It's a young woman's game.
Okay, where do we stand?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.112
I think we have everything. Yes!

10:12.195 --> 10:14.869
Oh, except the ladybug
night-light for Lily.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.122
Haley, your
whole life has led-

10:18.243 --> 10:20.837
I got it, Mom. I got it. Okay,
great, I'll see you in line.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.262
Yes, Ronald.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.723
I not only found it,
I got the last one.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.652
Yes, the ladybug,
not the turtle.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.104
I also got the doll, so I'm all set.
I'm gonna leave in five.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.832
Or maybe I just want paper. Paper. Paper.
Just paper all the way. Yeah.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.079
Haley!

11:01.911 --> 11:03.663
Too late to change my mind?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.839
Sir, would you like me to hold your
merchandise up at the register ...

11:07.917 --> 11:08.918
while you
finish shopping?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.879
Oh, aren't you a dream?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.345
Pack of gum.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.608
And ... one more pack of gum.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.147
People drop in
this time of year, you know.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.323
'Scuse me. Sorry.
Pardon me. Sorry.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.866
'Scuse me.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.239
Night-light you were looking for, ma'am.
Ring her up, Madison.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.071
Thank you.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.615
There you go.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.619
You're leaving me
alone here?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.579
No, no, no, no.
I- it'll, uh-

11:44.662 --> 11:46.164
it'll just take me
two minutes.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.420
I need to get Jay's
super-secret special gift.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.342
Great. First you lose me
in the grocery store.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.295
Now I'm in
a deserted parking lot.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.972
Why don't you just put a sign
on me that says "Free kid"?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.425
I think that might be him.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.223
You don't know the guy we're meeting?
That's how Craigslist works.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.101
Total strangers sell you things like
signed vintage baseball cards ...

12:02.180 --> 12:04.433
that make your father-in-law
respect you for an afternoon.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.609
I don't like
the looks of this guy.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.311
He looks
like everybody else.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.988
Great. You can just tell that
to the police sketch artist.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.487
Joe DiMaggio?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.739
Phil Dunphy,
but I get that a lot.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.536
Kidding.
I'm your guy.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.122
Can I see the cash?
Yes.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.916
Can I-
Can I see the card?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.539
Mint condition.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.090
That's why I want
another 50.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.712
I only have the 200.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.671
- Ah, deal's off then.
- Come on, it's Christmas.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.762
At our house.
it's a long story.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.344
- 225.
- I just spent all my cash on groceries.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.271
- Fine. But I'm taking the Butterball.
- I don't know about that.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.816
- That's it. I'm getting mother's little helper.
- What?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.939
- My mom keeps a stun gun for emergencies.
- This isn't an emergen-

12:53.606 --> 12:56.826
Now it is!

13:02.323 --> 13:03.791
I thought he was
going to snatch me!

13:03.866 --> 13:07.336
A Butterball is a tur-

13:07.412 --> 13:10.541
- What'd he say?
- I think he said, "A Butterball is a turkey."

13:10.623 --> 13:13.172
I was reaching for the turkey.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.800
Oh. Well, we can't
give you our turkey.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.722
Yes, we can.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.884
Here's the ... money.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.100
Yeah, buddy.
Joe DiMaggi-

13:29.183 --> 13:31.356
Joe DiMagg-

13:35.773 --> 13:40.119
Mint conditi-

13:40.194 --> 13:42.617
Near mint condi-

13:45.199 --> 13:47.748
Fair conditi-

13:49.620 --> 13:51.293
Garbage.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.762
Huh,
never saw this before.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.594
"An angel for my angels.
Love, Mom."

14:04.677 --> 14:06.645
A y, that's beautiful.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.063
And it smells like mothballs,
just like Nana. Luke.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.527
Th-Thank you. M-Merry Christmas.
Just give it up.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.604
Yeah.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.448
He hates us.
Don't beat yourself up.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.321
I do that,
like, once a week.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.404
The good news is, we never
have to come back here.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.739
Watch out!

14:25.656 --> 14:27.408
The tree! I can't watch!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.752
Look.
Ay, yes, I said "Luke."

14:29.869 --> 14:31.746
You told me already. I did it right.
No! Look!

14:31.829 --> 14:34.298
¬°Ay!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.297
Never look back.
Never!

14:39.754 --> 14:40.926
Maybe we can salvage it?

14:46.094 --> 14:47.812
Are you okay, papi?

14:47.929 --> 14:50.273
Yeah.
Good.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.191
That's because we had
our guardian angel-

14:52.266 --> 14:54.234
AM a spider!

15:02.151 --> 15:04.324
Hey, Morn.
Check it!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.077
The gum!

15:06.155 --> 15:09.125
Oh, and you made it pretty.
Honey, put it on the table.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.669
- New tradition?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.840
Mmm. Christmas gum. I take one.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.419
Tough to decorate the tree
with no tree, huh?

15:19.502 --> 15:21.300
Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.840
How long you gonna
ignore me, Cam?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.096
Until the shame cloud
clears.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.098
You know, I push.
I'm a pusher.

15:28.177 --> 15:32.523
You gotta give yourself a break. See, the thing
about me, I'm not as open with feelings as you.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.518
You've gotta lower
your expectations.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.229
Oh, I get it.
Baby steps.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.815
No steps. This is it.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.447
See? Did it again. Push,
push, push, push, push.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.029
Now I've pushed you out of the room.
That's- That's fine.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.658
How is she? I got the
tire marks off her wings,

15:49.740 --> 15:51.413
but I can't get her head
to stay on.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.836
Okay.
That's what this is for.

15:53.911 --> 15:58.792
Now, stick it in the top of the tree
with the good part facing out. Go on.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.345
Oh, that stuffing looks good. All we
need now is a turkey to surround it.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.549
Well, relax. Phil just texted,
and he's on his "wax."

16:06.340 --> 16:08.968
Okay.
Here comes the tree.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.348
Finally.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.896
Here comes
more of the tree.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.223
Hi, honey.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.774
Oh, my gosh.
What happened?

16:14.849 --> 16:16.317
Well, uh,
someone ran over it.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.904
But that's okay, 'cause we are gonna
put it back together. Right now.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.652
It's gonna need
a lot of gum.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.859
Oh, thank God. Here comes
Phil and the Butterball.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.614
I have a name!
Huh?

16:25.693 --> 16:28.287
I am sorry,
but there is no turkey.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.660
There's no turkey?
What's the plan, Phil?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.663
Cornish game hens.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.997
If you get real close, they look like
turkeys, and everyone gets their own.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.502
- Sounds like fun.
- Not fun. Not fun.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.256
I asked you to pick up
a cooked turkey.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.679
The store was out of turkeys. It
was an hour to express Christmas.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.098
Please just make it work, okay?
Please.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.766
Not even defrosted.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.264
- Fine, Claire! You want 'em defrosted?
- Yeah.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.938
Merry ... freaking ... Christmas!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.765
No!

16:56.474 --> 16:57.942
Is that my stun gun?

16:58.059 --> 16:59.686
Yep, and it works great!

16:59.810 --> 17:02.438
Okay, okay.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.775
Um, we can make this work.
This can work.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.031
- Dad, you and Mitchell reassemble that tree.
- All right.

17:08.109 --> 17:11.114
And I am going to defrost these birds.
We'll cook 'em in shifts,

17:11.196 --> 17:12.915
and we'll just push
dinner back by a bit.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.413
Oh, how long? 'Cause I
still have my party.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.621
- What the hell happened to the angel?
- No!

17:17.703 --> 17:21.333
The real question here is how come
we still have the dog butler?

17:21.415 --> 17:22.507
Oh, you found him, huh?

17:22.583 --> 17:25.211
Well, this thing is-
it's filthy and-

17:25.920 --> 17:26.887
What happened?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.806
It got run over.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.135
Probably by the same maniac
who ran over the tree.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.437
Oh, my God, is that?
Yep, that's gum.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.606
That is gum.
Okay, I'm- I'm out.

17:36.681 --> 17:40.402
I'm done. I am out.
No, no turkey, no tree,

17:40.476 --> 17:42.319
and now this looks like
the lady she used to be ...

17:42.395 --> 17:44.193
before she died
and became an angel.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.616
All right, relax, Mitchell.
it's an ornament.

17:46.691 --> 17:50.036
No, he's right. We're never gonna get this together.
I'm goin' to my party.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.079
No, no. No, you're not. You are not.
You're staying right here,

17:52.154 --> 17:54.873
because you're not going to
abandon your family on Christmas.

17:54.949 --> 17:55.871
It's not Christmas.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.744
Exactly, exactly.
Right. it's not.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.495
It's not Christmas, Claire.
it's not Christmas.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.252
Okay, fine. Fine.
You know what?

18:01.330 --> 18:04.209
I am really tired of trying to
make this work on my own.

18:04.292 --> 18:07.796
- I will see you people in a year.
- And nine days.

18:07.878 --> 18:11.098
No! Nobody goes anywhere.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.551
I know what the problem is here.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.262
You two miss your mommy.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.227
I do not miss my mommy.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.184
Admit it.
it's sad.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.020
She used to make you
cookies, the angel.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.481
Now, she talks to you
in a newsletter,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.532
and she cancels
for no reason.

18:28.608 --> 18:33.205
- Come here, my little ones.
- No, it's fine. We're good. It's not a big deal.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.032
It's Christmas.
You need a mommy.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.583
You're not our mommy.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.831
And it's not Christmas.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.628
Come here.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.377
It's okay to miss her.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.801
Can I put in my two cents
on fake Christmas?

18:46.876 --> 18:50.050
- Express Christmas.
- Let it go, Phil. It's not sticking.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.223
It needs time.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.892
We all gave it our best shot
to make this thing work.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.719
It just didn't happen,
all right?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.679
What do you say
we cut our losses?

18:58.763 --> 19:01.141
Let's go out to
a nice Chinese restaurant ...

19:01.223 --> 19:03.772
and have a traditional
Jewish Christmas.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.819
But I risked my life
grocery shopping.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.522
Save that story
for Wang Fu.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.699
Now, let's go. Come on, everybody.
On me!

19:09.774 --> 19:11.401
Gut!
Verybody Out!

19:11.525 --> 19:14.574
Dad, no. M.S.G.  Wang Fu.
it's on me. Let's go!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.327
- Come on, baby girl.
- Guys, there's always next year.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.998
- Come on, honey.
- This stinks.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.923
We have the snow!

19:28.626 --> 19:30.845
Dad!
Aw!

19:30.920 --> 19:33.048
You hate Chinese food.

19:34.131 --> 19:39.809
Not bad, huh?

19:39.929 --> 19:43.650
Jay, Jay, Jay. You want
to hug me, don't you?

19:43.766 --> 19:45.518
I kinda do.
Four to five seconds.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.771
Forty-five seconds?
Four to five seconds.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.696
Oh, okay.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.025
- Hey, buddy.
- Look at me!

19:53.734 --> 19:56.032
Family is family.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.864
Whether it's the one
you start out with-

19:57.988 --> 20:00.411
Hi, Mom. Merry Christmas.
Hi, Mom.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.537
Thank you. So, um, tell us
everything about the new boyfriend.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.163
Oh, yeah.
Don't leave anything out.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.543
Mmm. You can leave
some things out.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.340
The one that
you end up with-
