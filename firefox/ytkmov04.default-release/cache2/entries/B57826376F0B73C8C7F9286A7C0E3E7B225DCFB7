WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.596
There she is.
The old library.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.639
Had some late nights
in there.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.513
Some of 'em
I even spent studying.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.094
Don't tell your morn.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.054
And maybe don't tell me.
Oh.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.890
College!

00:15.015 --> 00:17.768
He was shielding his eyes from the sun.
Knew it when I hit it.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.694
Phil is taking Haley
to visit his alma mater.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.023
Loved college.

00:22.105 --> 00:25.200
Mmm. We are hoping some of that
enthusiasm rubs off on her.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.073
Go Bullfrogs!

00:27.152 --> 00:29.325
Dogs. Bulldogs.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
I feel like you do that on purpose.
Mm-mmm.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.457
No, it's just I say "bull," and I
can't remember if it's frogs or dogs.

00:35.536 --> 00:39.757
When I talk to my old friends from
college, do we croak or do we bark?

00:39.831 --> 00:41.879
I got it.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.721
Hello.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.056
Wow.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.480
No way. Haley, no way!
Check it out!

00:55.556 --> 00:57.900
After a few beers, my buds and I
would jump on these lunch trays ...

00:57.975 --> 00:59.397
and race down
this same hill.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.020
Hop on.
I don't want to hop on.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.238
Seriously. You'll get the giggles.
I don't want the giggles.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.450
Hey, honey.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.160
Hawk the trip going?
So good.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.326
Go Bullfrogs!

01:11.446 --> 01:13.574
It's dogs!
Oh, sorry.

01:13.657 --> 01:17.036
- How's Haley doing?
- She's-

01:17.160 --> 01:20.130
She's loving it.
She's loving it.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.874
Ready! I showed
her the student union.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.673
Five, six, seven, eight.
We visited the dorms.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.549
We sat in on a class.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.302
I really think she's starting to
see what college has to offer.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.516
Oh, hang on, Claire.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.394
Go Bulldogs!

01:36.346 --> 01:44.106
# Hey, hey #

01:44.187 --> 01:45.609
# Hey ##

01:48.900 --> 01:50.777
Manny, who is this Bella girl,

01:50.861 --> 01:53.239
and why is her name
all over your notebook?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.790
Bella's no girl, Mom.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.335
She has recently blossomed,
like a purple lilac in April.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.253
What do you mean, she blossom?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.293
Like the puberty?
Yep.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.633
I'll get it.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.881
Hey, Gloria, your
show's about to start.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.300
Record it.
No, the DVR's filling up.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.598
Let's just watch
and get it over with.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.597
Gloria's always saying we
should do more stuff together.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.146
So I agreed to watch this crazy
Colombian soap opera she loves.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.894
Fuego y hielo.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.193
Which apparently is Spanish
for "big hair and yelling."

02:23.268 --> 02:25.236
Fire and Ice.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.110
It's about human suffering.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.408
I relate to it.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.111
I'm just saying, the guy's a judge.
He could put a shirt on.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.497
A y, what is that?
Oh, nothing.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.246
That doesn't look like a nothing.
What is inside?

02:38.325 --> 02:39.827
Oh, it's just something
I bought

02:39.910 --> 02:41.787
I'm gonna go open it
in my room.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.168
I don't like this.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.500
Manny has never
kept a secret from me.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.378
Don't worry about it. What
do you think it could be?

02:49.461 --> 02:52.635
Well, right now, I'm a little worried
it could be the rest of my evening.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.426
Mwah! Bye-bye. Love you.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.728
Hey, Claire, listen. Uh,
if you want, some of the moms ...

02:57.803 --> 03:00.647
are going to stay and watch Gone with
the Wind in my new screening room.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.190
I got Pinot.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.189
I would love to, but I'm
not feeling that great, so-

03:05.268 --> 03:06.895
Probably just gonna go home
and rest.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.025
Plus, I've seen that movie.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.823
No, I never saw
Gone with the Wind.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.821
But I have two kids at sleepovers,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.698
and Haley's out of town with Phil.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.575
That means I have
one night to myself,

03:15.654 --> 03:17.497
which happens once every never.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.870
I am not spending it
with some gossipy mom ...

03:19.950 --> 03:21.702
who was mean to me
in high school.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.163
I need a fun night out.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.375
What the hell is this?

03:27.457 --> 03:30.256
No, I asked you guys
for a fun night out, not this.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.805
I need music and dancing
and secondhand smoke.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.882
Oh, please give this place a chance.
It's a great value.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.561
The room is so cozy, and the
pot pies are to die for.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.559
Are you really comfortable
with what you just said?

03:41.638 --> 03:44.858
Come on. What happened to the party
people who took me to a rave?

03:44.933 --> 03:48.437
And I got to wear a tube top, and I stuffed
cash in a caged go-go boy's Speedo.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.238
We're still party people.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.986
Oh, Joanne, before I
forget, can I get a punch?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.318
One away from a free pot pie.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.280
- If that was your gay card, it would be revoked.
- Okay, you know what, Claire?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.864
You're being a little
"high school you."

03:58.947 --> 04:00.915
I am sorry, Mitchell,
but I get one free night,

04:00.991 --> 04:04.962
and I can't spend it at a place that is
a proud supporter of Wilson Elementary.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.414
- We all need to give back, Claire.
- Oh, give me back my night.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.592
Okay, well, Longines did invite
us to a boutique opening.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.419
You know, cocktails, deejay.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.381
it'll be whole scene though.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.683
A scene? A scene is perfect.
That's great.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.853
I will get in the car before you guys
change your mind. Come on. Let's go.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.474
So does that mean
no pot pies?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.353
Uh- Hey, Joanne,
two number nines to go.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.851
Was I wrong?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.650
Are these not the best wings you've
ever had in your life? Oh, my God!

04:30.729 --> 04:32.606
And you didn't want
to get 40.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.568
Oh, and by the way, this is
just the start of your evening.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.280
Next up, it's over to the quad for a
musical interlude from Tenors, Anyone?

04:39.404 --> 04:42.203
It's an all-male singing group.
Got it.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.624
Oh, hey! Oh, hey, weren't you
on my tour this morning?

04:45.744 --> 04:48.293
Yeah, I'm Haley, and
this is my- Big brother.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.169
You bought it for a second!
How are you?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.918
Oh. That's-
Okay.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.720
Anyway, you know what? There is a
student mixer going on tonight.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.549
If you want to go, me and a bunch
of girls are gonna head over there.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.475
Oh, uh-

05:00.550 --> 05:02.518
Know what? That's okay.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.473
My dad's got this whole thing
planned, but thank you anyway.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.273
No problem. Well, it
was nice meeting you.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.851
Nice meeting you.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.401
How fun is this?
Just me and you.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.029
I was a little nervous you wouldn't see
what's so special about this place.

05:16.149 --> 05:20.029
Not that I'm pushing you to come here. You
know, you're gonna make your own decisions.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.332
You want to go with them, don't you?
No, we're doing our thing.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.330
Yeah, quick, before they leave.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.249
Are you sure?
Go. I can handle it.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.330
You're not the first girl
to leave me at this table ...

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
with a plateful
of chicken wings.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.796
I'm kidding.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.343
Wish I was kidding.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.757
You weren't supposed
to hear that.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.755
Have fun.
Okay.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.099
Love you.
Love you.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.816
Nose job. Ooh.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.237
Butt lift. Last summer, that thing
was four inches off the ground.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.690
What do they do with all
the butt they take out?

05:56.773 --> 05:58.366
I have a theory.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.911
Oh, hell!
Here comes my ex.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.204
Who, Randolph?
Marcus?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.827
- Lamichael?
- No, Matt.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.291
Oh.
I gotta go!

06:06.366 --> 06:08.664
Drama! Love it!

06:08.743 --> 06:10.745
This is what I wanted.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.090
Who needs a drink? I could
use a little seltzer water.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.550
More bubbly, Claire? I will
be after I get a drink.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.220
See, that's what
gay is supposed to be like.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.266
Okay, I don't know about you, but I got
about five minutes of fabulous left in me.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.013
Yeah. In my mind,
I'm already in our kitchen ...

06:24.092 --> 06:26.561
and I'm watching my pot pie
rotate in the microwave.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.730
Okay, okay.
When did hats come back?

06:28.805 --> 06:32.025
That one's come back about eight times.
Pick a side of the room, lady!

06:32.100 --> 06:35.274
All right, there's, like, a
thousand people waiting for wine.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.026
I want to try on
a couple of dresses,

06:37.105 --> 06:39.608
and then Julian here is going to
take us to a club across town.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.534
I think we're gonna go home.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.283
What? Why? it's 9:30.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.954
It's 9:30?

06:45.030 --> 06:47.032
When did you two
become such old women?

06:47.115 --> 06:49.413
First you take me to that
senior center for porridge,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.540
and now you can't even stay up
past Luke's bedtime?

06:51.620 --> 06:53.964
It's Friday. We get tired on Fridays.
We get very tired.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.918
I have three children.
I have been tired since 2005.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.502
Let's rally.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.680
You're my ride. If you want to
stay out, I can take you home.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.764
Really?
Of course.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.262
Okay.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.061
All right, girls, go home, roll up
your hair, clap out the lights,

07:08.136 --> 07:10.810
'cause this guy,
who I just met,

07:10.931 --> 07:12.854
is gonna show me a good time.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.982
Okay, well, if he was straight, this
would be just like high school.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.322
This is ridiculous.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.276
She's obviously got a pistol
under that poncho.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.827
How do you watch this stuff?

07:23.902 --> 07:27.281
He's been up there for more than one hour.
I can't stand it.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.833
Who's been up there? Reinaldo's doin'
the dishes right in front of her.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.330
Manny, in his bedroom.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.002
Gloria, are you
even watching this?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.580
I'm doin' this for you.

07:34.663 --> 07:38.759
What does he has in that box
that he cannot show to me?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.961
Little boys are supposed to
keep secrets from their mothers.

07:41.044 --> 07:44.048
Wait. The judge
just peeked through the window.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.259
Is he interested in Celia now?
She could be his daughter.

07:47.384 --> 07:51.264
I bet it's a birthday gift for me.
Yeah, that sounds right.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.848
What's he saying?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.899
I've never seen him this mad.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.773
Wait a minute.

07:56.851 --> 08:00.196
I already found my birthday
gift underneath his bed.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.989
It's a giant hat.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.908
When did hats
came back, anyway?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.657
Now she's reaching
under the poncho.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.408
Like she's gonna shoot Reinaldo.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.205
He's the main character, right?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.497
That's it.
I'm going up there.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.995
Wait, Gloria, no, don't go.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.461
Why not? Think about it.
Thirteen-year-old boy.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.129
Talks about girls all day long.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.083
We have more security on these
computers than the Pentagon.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.213
What do you think
he's doin' up there, alone?

08:23.795 --> 08:25.593
Do you think
he ordered some movies?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.265
Movies, magazines.
Whatever the hell.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.093
How dare do you say that,
Jay?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.520
He's a little boy!
He's just a boy.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.643
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm gonna take a walk.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.350
Gloria, come on.
Come back.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.231
I know you're not mad at me.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.275
You just-

08:39.394 --> 08:42.523
Oh! What'd she do?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.107
Reinaldo!

08:45.316 --> 08:47.614
Oh! Wang chung!

08:47.694 --> 08:49.571
Pay UP, gentlemen!

08:49.654 --> 08:52.624
Oh, yes!

08:52.699 --> 08:54.201
Thank you!

08:54.284 --> 08:55.831
Really? That's so nice.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.753
Another pitcher,
my good woman.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.502
Claire would have killed me
if she'd known ...

08:59.581 --> 09:02.551
that I let Haley go off alone while I
chilled in a bar with some undergrads,

09:02.625 --> 09:04.719
but I happen
to trust my daughter.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.136
Also, I was tracking her location
with the G.P.S. on her phone.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.810
Fellas, Cedar and Los Alamos.
That's, uh-

09:12.886 --> 09:15.435
- Pi Chi house?
- Pi Chi?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.984
Come on. Why
is my Bluetooth not working?

09:27.067 --> 09:30.367
Oh, God, it's Longines.
He's gonna be so mad at us.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.831
Hey, Longe, don't
be mad at us for leaving.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.829
I went back to our
spot, and everybody was gone.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.410
Who does that to a sister?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.336
We're sorry,
but the sitter called,

09:38.411 --> 09:40.630
and Lily
was running a fever, so-

09:40.705 --> 09:44.300
We feel even worse about dumping
Claire on you and your hot date.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.423
Who is gorgeous, by the way.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.346
Seems super funny too.
Perfect for you.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.219
Please.
I wish that was a date.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.051
He is my trainer, and he's straight.
What? Julian's straight?

09:53.134 --> 09:56.559
Oh, I love it when a straight person
and a gay person go out together.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.436
I'd love it a lot more
if he was gay.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.108
Oh, my God.
This isn't our car.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.602
What?
This isn't our Prius.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
They must've given us the
wrong one at the valet.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.693
That's why the Bluetooth
isn't working.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.774
We stole a car. Are you serious?
What's happening?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.484
Oh, we stole a car.
Uh, we gotta go.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.286
We did not steal a car, Cam.
It was given to us.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.865
Why are you giving me attitude?
You're the one that stole a car!

10:14.948 --> 10:17.792
How is this a stolen car? How?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.290
I don't know! I'm confused!
Do you have an aspirin?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.293
This isn't my car!

10:22.413 --> 10:24.836
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.503
Mmm. Hey, Lukey.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.633
Hi. What's goin' on?

10:29.712 --> 10:32.306
Oh, I don't have-
I'll check.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.513
I have it.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.937
Well, I could bring it by and
meet you outside in 20 minutes.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.764
No, sweet-
Out-Outside, sweetie.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.191
Okay. Bye-We-

10:41.266 --> 10:44.145
Do you mind swinging by
my kid's sleepover?

10:44.227 --> 10:46.776
I gotta give him his retainer.
It's on the way to the club.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.991
Sure. No problem.
Oh, you are so sweet.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.286
Holy pythons, Batman!
Do you ever leave the gym?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.455
Uh, no. Actually, I'm a
trainer and a masseur.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.328
Oh, my God.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.125
I'm gonna have to try out
that second one.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.168
Zip, please.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.963
I gotta say, this night
is turning out to be ...

11:04.038 --> 11:05.540
a lot more fun
than I expected.

11:05.623 --> 11:09.048
I've got two kids at sleepovers
and one upstate with Daddy.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.596
The fun is just beginning.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.514
Unbelievable.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.396
The valet gave our car away to
someone, like, an hour and a half ago.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.942
You know what that means.

11:25.059 --> 11:29.360
Our pot pies could be anywhere by now.
They probably went home.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.363
If we knew their address, maybe we
could see if our car was there.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.319
Oh, yeah, and how do you propose
we do that?

11:34.402 --> 11:37.246
Calculating route home.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.542
Oh, you're good. Oh, and look.
Only .6 miles away.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.962
Prepare to turn night
in 500 feel.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.665
Notice how she didn't wait until
a?er the turn to tell me, Cam?

11:46.789 --> 11:49.042
Really? This? Now?
I'm just-

11:49.125 --> 11:52.004
Oh, look, they went to see Jay-Z. We
almost went to see Jay-Z, didn't we?

11:52.086 --> 11:54.009
No, no, no. 'Cause, remember?
It started at 8:30.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.136
Oh, yeah, which meant he wouldn't
have gone on till 10:00.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.935
- And that's a parking nightmare.
- Oh, and those stairs.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.304
Okay,
I'm hearing it now.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.139
Is Claire right?
Are we in a rut?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.317
Oh, we might be, especially
compared to these people.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.519
Look at this.
Canc√∫n luggage tickets.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.570
A parking pass to Yosemite.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.195
A triathlon bib.
This is living.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.571
No, but, you know,
we have Lily, okay?

12:14.692 --> 12:17.491
You can't do that with a child.
They have a car seat.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.077
Okay, fine, we're in a rut.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.284
Destination ahead
in 900 feet.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.211
You know, maybe we just need to be
around more stimulating people.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.084
Well, we're gonna be
in about 900 feet.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.461
It's not the craziest idea.
They seem like fun people.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.918
Yeah, and maybe we can be new couples
friends with them, you know?

12:32.001 --> 12:35.972
We can go out to concerts, try exciting
new food, maybe do some luxury camping.

12:36.047 --> 12:40.052
Hitch our wagon to their star and see
how fast they spice up our life.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.053
You have arrived.
I believe we have.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.853
You dumb son of a bitch!

12:45.932 --> 12:47.400
Oh, my God, what's happening?

12:47.517 --> 12:49.019
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What's happening?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.979
I can't believe
you came back here,

12:51.104 --> 12:52.822
you filthy, cheating pig!
No, no, back up.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.151
- Back up, I said!
- I'm trying! We are in a rut.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.907
Really? You want to talk
about that right now?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.325
No, we are stuck.
We're in an actual rut.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.079
We're stuck.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

13:03.199 --> 13:06.043
We are victim of a hate crime right now.
Go! Go! Oh, my God.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.340
Oh, no, you don't. Dad!
What are you doing here?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.007
What's this, buddy?
Ginger ale.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.589
Oh, really?
Cause it smells-

13:17.672 --> 13:19.549
Okay, it smells like ginger ale,
but that doesn't prove anything.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.259
What the hell?
We are leaving.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.307
I'm having a nice time!
With this clown?

13:23.428 --> 13:27.058
And by the way, it's a little cliche to pick
someone who looks exactly like your dad.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.983
I got your number, Pi Chi.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.194
I know you.
Yeah, you do.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.988
This is Ben Ford. He's in my class.
He's visiting too.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.690
You were my T-ball coach.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.743
My dad's your doctor.
He's right over there.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.492
What is wrong with you?

13:41.571 --> 13:44.074
Are you trying to ruin college
for me before I even get here?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.875
No, I'm not.
I am so sorry.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.874
You are not a clown. You are
an excellent backup shortstop.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.920
Alecia, Bruce.
Go Bullfrogs- Dogs!

13:52.999 --> 13:55.593
Go Bulldogs. Claire!

13:55.668 --> 13:57.796
Wow. Really.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.890
No, it's just a shock, is all.
Jay.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.468
So Celia is carrying
the judge's baby.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.770
No wonder she shot him.
She's hormonal.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.472
- Who are you talking to?
- The housekeeper.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.307
Maria, I've gotta go.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.858
Thanks a lot.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.857
- Jay, I need you to talk to Manny.
- What?

14:13.936 --> 14:17.236
If he's doing what you think he's
doing, then he needs to talk to a man.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.158
I don't want him
to be ashamed of anything.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.279
Then you don't want to send me in there.
But what if he has questions?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.950
What if he doesn't know how-
Gloria-

14:24.030 --> 14:27.455
Gloria, whatever he's going through,
he can work it out himself.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.206
Help! I'm stuck!

14:29.285 --> 14:32.289
Ay, no. Jay, go! I beg of
you, go, go, go! Gloria-

14:32.372 --> 14:34.750
I'm extremely reluctant
to do this.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.379
Please hurry!

14:36.459 --> 14:38.336
Ay, no. I cannot look at this.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.681
What the hell?
I can't get down, Jay!

14:43.299 --> 14:44.516
What? What
happened to Manny?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.435
Ay, somebody
say something to me!

14:46.511 --> 14:47.888
Gloria, it's okay.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.480
Come in.
Okay.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.734
- He was hanging from that bar up there.
- What? Why?

14:53.810 --> 14:55.483
What do you have on your head?

14:55.561 --> 14:58.235
It's a weighted helmet to
stretch me so I can get taller.

14:58.356 --> 15:02.077
Whoa! Manny, why do you
have to get tall now?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.903
Love, Mom. Why else?

15:03.986 --> 15:07.957
I lost Bella to Durkas because,
in her words, "He's tall."

15:08.032 --> 15:09.705
Everybody else
is getting taller but me.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.295
You think it's the coffee? No.

15:12.370 --> 15:16.170
Maybe, but- But hanging downside
up is not gonna help you.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.251
The Web site said it would.

15:18.334 --> 15:23.340
Listen, Manny, you're already
intelligent and beautiful and funny.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.768
If you get tall, you're
going to have everything,

15:26.843 --> 15:30.598
and those poor boys are not gonna
have anything to compete with you.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.432
Look at this.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.734
You have a mark
in your head now.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.527
I'm gonna go get you
some ice, okay?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.365
That's a lot of pretty words,
but they don't help me tomorrow.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.113
Sorry, kid.
Just one of those things.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.785
You get taller
when you get taller.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.784
Why don't you
get ready for bed?

15:52.910 --> 15:55.208
Ah, geez.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.838
You know, when I was your age, I
started workin' out to get the girls.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.964
- You think that would help?
- Yeah.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.262
So tomorrow,
we start workin' out.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.839
Okay?

16:04.922 --> 16:08.927
Maybe I'll even show you a few pull-ups
on, uh, this bad boy here, huh?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.150
You see that?

16:16.225 --> 16:19.604
Pretty soon, that's how strong
you're gonna be.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.491
Thanks, Mom. Shh! I don't
want them to know I was here.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.239
Okay. Oh, Claire, I
thought that was you.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.740
Thank God. Come in.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.197
I can't, 'cause I'm sick, remember?
Sorry.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.999
My DVD playerjust broke, and none of
us know how Gone with the Wind ends.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.667
- But you saw it, right?
- Is that Claire?

16:33.743 --> 16:35.495
- Yeah.
- Can you tell us what happened?

16:35.578 --> 16:37.797
Uh, I could, but I don't want
to ruin it for you.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.712
Claire, just tell us.
Just tell us.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.043
Come on.
Um-

16:42.126 --> 16:47.508
Scarlett is really mad
at Clark Gable because, um,

16:47.590 --> 16:49.467
he's done just so-
so many bad things.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.929
And didn't he, um, burn down
a farm or something?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.185
Claire, have you been drinking?

16:55.264 --> 16:57.813
Um, I had a hot toddy.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.360
Made one for my throat, so-

16:59.435 --> 17:02.109
Pretty dressed up
for a night in bed, right?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.816
Yeah, I-l just threw on the first
thing I could find when Luke called.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.367
- It was just right there on the chair.
- She has a stamp on her hand.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.992
Okay. All right. Before we bust out
the pitchforks and the torches,

17:11.071 --> 17:13.996
may I remind you that I've driven
every one of your children home,

17:14.075 --> 17:15.667
and heimliched
at least one, Bethenny.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.377
Hi.  Hello.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.797
This is totally inappropriate,
but could I use your bathroom?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.339
Sorry.
You kept pushing the drinks.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.009
It's- Friend.
Gay friend. Gay.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.127
I'm not gay.
Yes, you are.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.385
I'm not gay. I'm-I'm French.
You thought I was gay?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.137
Are you serious right now?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.184
Are you? You've been throwing
yourself at me all night.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.262
N-No. No. I have not.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.814
- Bethenny, grab the Pinot.
- Bethenny, do not grab the Pinot.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.359
You undressed in front of me.
You squeezed my arm.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.186
You asked me for a massage.
What was all that?

17:42.270 --> 17:46.275
That was- That was me safely
objectifying a gay person.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.030
Wow, Claire.

17:48.109 --> 17:51.363
When I wrote "Don't ever change" in your
yearbook, I didn't mean it like this.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.243
Oh, ease up, Holly.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.201
Okay, I lied. I lied.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.707
But I get one night to myself,

17:58.786 --> 18:02.632
and I just wanted to spend it
with some fun gay people.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.550
It's not my fault this one
decided to be straight.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.170
I've always been straight.
Oh, you don't get to talk!

18:07.253 --> 18:09.597
I took fashion advice
from you.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.891
Oh, my God, do I even
look good in this dress?

18:11.966 --> 18:14.264
No, not you.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.812
- It's really short, isn't it?
- it's short.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.389
Yeah.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.940
Please! Please just listen
to me for one second.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.817
Go away!
Stop following me.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.943
Hey, you want to tell me why
you're bothering this younglady?

18:27.023 --> 18:29.401
Oh, no, no, no, no, Officer.
This is my daughter. Tell him.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.950
Tonight, I don't know who you are.
She's-She's joking.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.372
I'm not dangerous.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.495
In fact, I helped to put
all the lights on this path.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.794
Twenty years ago, some friends
and I took back the night, so-

18:39.869 --> 18:43.294
I think I just-
I embarrassed her a little.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.717
A little? That sweatshirt
embarrasses me a little.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.879
Yep, that's a daughter.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.886
Tonight was insane. Why did
you have to act like that?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.764
You were at that party. I see
you talking to frat boys, and-

18:55.843 --> 18:58.972
isn't that why we're here?
So I can experience college?

18:59.055 --> 19:01.399
I mean, what are you gonna
do when I actually go?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.603
I don't know.
Freak out, I think.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.107
Look.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.154
Your whole life,
my job's been to protect you.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.035
A job I kind of love.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.287
And I feel like I'm being forced
into early retirement.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.255
I just needed to find you
and make sure you were okay-

19:25.748 --> 19:28.376
for as long
as I still get to do that.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.589
It's just like you-

19:33.673 --> 19:36.142
Piss me off,
then say something sweet.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.271
I'm not leaving
until the fall.

19:40.346 --> 19:44.101
Maybe by then I can figure out how
to put a force field around you.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.150
I've been working on that one
since the first time ...

19:48.229 --> 19:51.028
I tried to fasten you
into your car seat.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.656
I pinched
your chunky little thigh.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.738
Aw.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.993
Even though you basically
just called me fat.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.215
So, is it really fun?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.792
What?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.717
No.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.019
We all struggle
with limitations.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.062
Some we're willing to accept-

20:22.138 --> 20:26.393
You know, I just want to be home,
reading on opposite ends of the sofa.

20:26.517 --> 20:29.862
And some we're not. I'm
so embarrassed I did that.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.156
I'm just so happy
that that was all it was.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.279
Why? What'd you think
I was doing?

20:35.443 --> 20:36.990
It's never too late
to grow in life.

20:37.111 --> 20:40.536
Oh, my God!

20:40.614 --> 20:43.163
"Thanks to our patented
Lengthenator,

20:43.242 --> 20:46.212
you can increase your height
by up to four inches."

20:46.328 --> 20:49.753
I cannot believe he spent
$50 in this thing. I know.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.631
He could've got a two-year
subscription to Playboy for that.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.801
He's not getting the Playboy ever!
Ow!

20:55.880 --> 20:57.382
He's a little boy!

21:01.552 --> 21:03.429
Wouldn't it be great
if we woke up tomorrow,

21:03.512 --> 21:05.105
and our car had
found its way home?

21:05.181 --> 21:06.774
I feel that's not the way
it's gonna happen.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.351
Happened on the farm one time.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.108
A tornado scooped up one of our
calves, dropped it who knows where.

21:11.187 --> 21:14.737
Six months later, a full-grown cow
comes walking up the driveway.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.067
Same markings, same moo.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.035
That night, we- We ate like kings.
Yeah.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.112
Okay, I've told it before.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.869
Oh, my gosh, it's our car!

21:23.699 --> 21:25.872
I see you've met my wife.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.459
