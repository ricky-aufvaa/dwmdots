WEBVTT

00:03.253 --> 00:05.130
So then what happened?

00:05.214 --> 00:09.264
Well, she didn't show up to school the next day,
and I heard that she slept over at his dorm.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.970
No way.
Mm-hmm.

00:11.053 --> 00:14.023
Seriously, are you surprised?
Do you not know Carly?

00:14.097 --> 00:16.020
Have you seen
what she wears to school?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.022
Girls, let's cool it
on the gossip, okay?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.354
It's not right, and Carly's
got enough problems.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.155
What do you mean?

00:22.231 --> 00:25.906
Well, her mom can't get through a soccer
practice without a thermos of Chardonnay,

00:25.984 --> 00:27.702
and don't get me started
on the dad.

00:27.778 --> 00:28.745
That guy-

00:28.862 --> 00:29.829
Oh!

00:29.947 --> 00:31.415
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:31.532 --> 00:34.206
Mom! Oh, this is such a
dangerous intersection!

00:34.284 --> 00:36.707
Did I get lipstick
on my face?

00:36.787 --> 00:38.380
No, you're fine.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.629
And consider yourself lucky you didn'tjust
get, like, felt up by your mom.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.378
They need to get a stop sign. What
is your obsession with traffic?

00:44.461 --> 00:46.384
It's an obsession
with safety.

00:46.505 --> 00:50.180
One of these days, Joe Speeder is gonna come
tearin' through here, and somebody's gonna-

00:50.259 --> 00:52.261
Oh, my God!

00:52.386 --> 00:54.388
I'm okay.
Oh! Oh, my God.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.098
I'm okay. Hey, GUYS-

00:56.223 --> 00:57.816
Phil?
Yeah. No, I'm good.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.440
Gotta keep movin'.
Keep the heart rate up.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.396
Oh. Okay.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.277
How's my face?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.484
- Still good.
- Okay, good.

01:07.651 --> 01:15.752
# Hey, hey #

01:15.826 --> 01:16.998
# Hey ##

01:18.745 --> 01:22.170
Gloria, how many times do I have to tell
you to pull your car all the way in?

01:22.249 --> 01:23.842
The gate was open
all night.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.921
We live in a nice neighborhood.
What are you afraid of?

01:27.004 --> 01:31.225
That some money's gonna ?y in, and then
your gardener is gonna have to rake it up?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.515
Jay, I'm going to need you
to cut me a check.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.014
What now? Drama club trip.
Les Mis√©rables.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.475
We're selling wrapping paper
to raise money for the tickets.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.027
No, no. Wait, wait. Slow down.
What's the story exactly?

01:42.102 --> 01:44.981
Well, Jean Valjean spent 19 years in prison
for stealing a loaf of bread-

01:45.063 --> 01:46.280
The wrapping Paper-

01:46.356 --> 01:48.779
Nineteen years for a loaf of bread?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.486
How good was this bread?

01:50.611 --> 01:54.036
It wasn't about the bread. It was about
the society where- Focus, people!

01:54.114 --> 01:56.082
Manny, we'll buy
all your wrapping paper.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.002
No, we won't.
No, he's got to learn to sell.

01:59.077 --> 02:02.206
This is the best business training there is.
Hell, the best life training.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.791
Manny, write this down.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.879
A good salesman goes after
Moby-Dick in a rowboat ...

02:07.961 --> 02:10.931
and brings the tartar sauce
with him.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.885
Jay's always telling
me to "write this down."

02:13.967 --> 02:17.016
I don't always catch everything he says.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.725
"Something, something, firm handshake."

02:20.807 --> 02:23.310
"Never take the first room they show you."

02:23.393 --> 02:25.816
I'm not sure who "they" is.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.820
And this one just says "pancakes."

02:28.899 --> 02:32.119
Cam, what's this scribbled on the
Vanity Fair about an adoption agency?

02:32.194 --> 02:35.368
Oh, yeah, they called to say they
wanted to reschedule our home visit.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.165
When? Why didn't you tell me?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.742
This is kind of important.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.461
Well, when does it say?
Uh, who knows?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.880
It disappears
into Jennifer Aniston's hair.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.548
You gotta get
a better system.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.797
There is nothing wrong
with my system.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.005
Ask me anything about any upcoming event,
and I can tell you when and where it is.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.841
When is
the adoption agency visit?

02:53.924 --> 02:56.552
Okay. Is that
a 5 or a curl?

02:56.635 --> 02:58.637
Oh, I hope Jen's
finally found love.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.695
What happened here?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.647
Well, Lily and I woke up
in a French mood,

03:08.730 --> 03:10.198
so we decided
to whip up some crepes.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.197
When are you gonna be in the
mood to wipe up some crepes?

03:13.276 --> 03:15.153
I know, it's a little messy,
but you know what?

03:15.278 --> 03:16.575
I'm gonna clean it up.
Okay.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.078
- I'm gonna clean it up.
- Will you?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.955
- Just say what's on your mind.
- You never clean up.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.170
Save the gasp.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.963
Cam, whenever you get
creative in the kitchen,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.040
I'm the one who ends up
cleaning it up, okay?

03:27.124 --> 03:30.173
The homemade pizza. Fondue.
Molecular gastronomy.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.505
I'm still cleaning shrimp foam
out of the curtains.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.010
Okay, you know what, Mitchell?
Just go to work, okay?

03:35.090 --> 03:37.513
I'm gonna take Lily to school
and then when I get home,

03:37.634 --> 03:40.012
I'm gonna scrub this place like
a crime scene.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.063
Which it is,
because you've murdered joy.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.316
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.817
Hey, Dad. Think fast.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.451
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.073
Oh, my God!

03:56.153 --> 03:58.747
If we had that on tape, it'd be
the greatest YouTube video ever.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.496
We'd get, like, a million hits.
This is our double rainbow!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.373
We need to do it again.

04:03.452 --> 04:07.252
Oh, I would, buddy, but, uh, your mom's all
over me to change a bunch of lightbulbs.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.833
How many moms does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.426
I don't know.
None.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.254
'Cause they get you to do it, sucker.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.680
Ah!

04:16.757 --> 04:21.137
I laughed,
but ... it hurt a little.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.187
We're home.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.606
Us too.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.308
Oh, great.
You're all here.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.984
What's up, girl?
Oh.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.857
You know that really
dangerous intersection?

04:29.936 --> 04:33.236
Where desire meets jealousy,
and the result is murder?

04:33.315 --> 04:35.283
Mm-mmm. The one where I almost
killed you this morning.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.157
Oh, yeah. Sorry. That was my bad.
I got lost in my jams.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.490
speed walkin' and Speedwagon.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.826
Oh! I wasn't even
tryin' for that.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.252
Nice.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.955
Well, I am getting us
a stop sign.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.587
I called city hall.
And how is this for amazing?

04:50.665 --> 04:52.417
The traffic committee
meets tonight.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.636
I've got goose bumps.
I know! Right?

04:54.711 --> 04:58.636
All I have to do is get 50
signatures, show up, make my case.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.759
It's on.
I am so proud of you.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.560
We all are.
Hmm.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.855
We love when
Mom gets on a project.

05:04.930 --> 05:08.560
Because usually the minute any of us walks
in the door, she gives us something to do.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.482
"Do your homework. Clean
your room." "Put on pants."

05:11.561 --> 05:14.690
Like the queen's comin' over.
Am I right?

05:14.773 --> 05:19.574
So when she's not around or gets busy,
Luke and I capitalize on the situation.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.747
There you are,
my good man.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.449
Squire.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.496
Let's do it.
Whoo!

05:25.575 --> 05:27.418
Get ya some!

05:27.494 --> 05:29.121
Well, I think
it's awesome.

05:29.204 --> 05:33.084
I'm so glad, because I could really use
your help getting these signatures.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.430
I'll do it. Soon as I change
those lightbulbs you wanted.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.098
Great. Kids?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.097
Crud. You know,
I've got a ton of homework.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.850
Uh, science project.

05:45.929 --> 05:46.930
Haley?

05:47.013 --> 05:50.358
I need to get started
on my college essay.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.061
You know what? Maybe
I'll write it about you.

05:53.144 --> 05:56.114
You're just so inspirational.
Girl power.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.362
- You rock.
- Thanks, honey.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.744
I do rock.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.744
Stella, down.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.494
Stella, no.
This is very dangerous.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.335
Okay, se√±orita, that's it.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.759
Come here, because Jay is gonna be
very mad if something happens to you.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.221
A y, tener que cuidar
perra ahora. Ou√© belleza.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.142
Go play with the ball!
See you later.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.970
Now I can cook.
Do my empanada.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.771
The gate. Ay, no.
Ay, no. The gate.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.602
The gate!

06:33.685 --> 06:35.858
Stella, come back!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.956
Hey there, Mr. Salesman.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.000
Can we not talk
about business?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.453
- That bad, huh?
- I gave it everything I got.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.664
Working the dimples,
going big eyes.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.717
It got me two things-
diddly and squat.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.795
- How many houses you hit?
- I don't know.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.218
It must've been at least three.
Three!

07:02.297 --> 07:04.550
And that's your idea
of the best you got?

07:04.633 --> 07:07.853
It was very hard on me.
I'm not used to rejection.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.350
Or hills.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.729
Look, you can't quit after three houses.
That's not perseverance.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.310
- What are you sellin'?
- Wrapping paper.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.146
Wrong.
You're selling Christmas.

07:18.229 --> 07:21.073
The excitement of opening presents.
The taste of eggnog.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.785
I do love eggnog.
Write this down.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.490
What's the difference
between "try" and "triumph"?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.041
A little oomph?
A little oomph.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.661
Get it? Of course I get it.
I just said it.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.917
Eeeh! I'm gonna kill you
when I find you, silly dog!

07:37.999 --> 07:39.876
Why don't you come back?
Stella!

07:40.001 --> 07:42.800
I have a theory. Ay, Cam,
thank you for helping me.

07:42.879 --> 07:46.474
Oh, it's my pleasure.
Stella!

07:46.549 --> 07:48.051
Stella!

07:49.761 --> 07:52.685
Oh, my God.
What? You see her?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.266
No.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.898
But I see myself in the role
I was born to play.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.401
Stella!

08:02.649 --> 08:05.243
Stella!

08:10.573 --> 08:11.790
Hello?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.868
Oh, Mitchell, you are
not gonna believe this.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.954
I'm out helping Gloria
look for her dog.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.917
I'm wearing an undershirt, and I'm screaming
"Stella," just like in Streetcar.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.385
Hello ? You didn't
clean the kitchen!

08:22.460 --> 08:24.929
Mitchell, I am an inadvertent
Stanley Kowalski.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.554
- How can you not be delighted by this?
- You promised.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.384
I was called away
for an emergency.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.469
Gloria's lost her dog,
and she's heartbroken.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.852
Where are you, dumb dog?
I hope in a big black hole!

08:34.931 --> 08:38.652
I cannot believe that you
did this to me yet again. Oh.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.525
I didn't do anything.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.605
I cooked a meal
in our kitchen.

08:42.688 --> 08:46.489
Then you left on purpose, knowing I would not
be able to sit here without cleaning it up.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.822
Life is messy sometimes.
Big deal. It gets cleaned up.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.701
You're the one with the problem if you can't
leave a few dirty dishes for a couple hours.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.127
Okay, okay. Fine, Cam.
I'm not cleaning it up.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.292
Great.
I mean it.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.339
Perfect. You know what?
Why don't you make it bigger?

09:00.415 --> 09:02.838
You know what?
I will. l-l- I will-

09:02.959 --> 09:06.805
Okay, you know, get ready, because you are
gonna come home to a- to a giant mess.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.635
And I will give him a giant hug
when I get there.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.264
Stella!

09:15.972 --> 09:17.940
Hey, Dad.
Think fast.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.815
Oh! Wow, buddy.
I'm sorry.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.774
I told you, I gotta change the lightbulbs and
then help your mom with those signatures.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.608
Never mind.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.819
Guess it was
a stupid idea anyways.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.372
I've always said that if my son thinks
of me as one of his idiot friends,

09:33.448 --> 09:34.995
then I've succeeded as a dad.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.578
If he wants to go the wrong way
on the escalator, I'm on board.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.129
If he wants to go into a restaurant
and pretend we're Australian, then-

09:40.205 --> 09:41.707
G'day, mate.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.384
Toss a few shrimp on the barbie
for me and my joey.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.963
Yeah, right? Nicole Kidman?
Men At Work?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.766
Here we go.
Take 12.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.639
- Hey, buddy, I'm home!
- Hey, Dad. Think fast!

09:53.718 --> 09:55.391
0w!

09:55.470 --> 09:58.770
Wow. You know, my arm's
starting to hurt a little.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.691
Really?
'Cause my face feels great.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.861
Come on, Dad. Let's not
turn on each other.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.110
- We could be here a while.
- Yeah, okay. You're right.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.362
Here we go.
Take nine-

10:08.441 --> 10:11.069
You're not even trying.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.955
Daddy, Fm hungry-

10:18.076 --> 10:20.499
What do you want, honey?
Raisins.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.580
All right.
Well, go get 'em.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.629
It's too high, Daddy.
I can't reach.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.713
For the record,
I am not a neat freak.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.346
In fact, in my first
long-term relationship,

10:33.424 --> 10:36.849
I was the messy one,
which is why she broke up with me.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.430
Well-

10:38.513 --> 10:40.732
No, thanks.
Okay.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me show you how it's done.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.739
Hiya. Jay Pritchett here. Holidays
are just around the corner.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.820
Sorry. I don't believe
in wrapping paper.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.157
What do you mean, you don't believe in wrapping paper?
It's not Bigfoot. It exists.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.956
It's not eco-friendly. It's wasteful.
No, not this stuff.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.288
This paper was made from
100% recycled materials.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.166
I don't think so.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.502
I can't understand
what you're saying.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.633
She's an ugly little
French Bulldog ...

11:10.712 --> 11:12.965
with the tiny ears
and the smooshy face.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.141
What is so hard
to understand?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.184
Maybe I should translate.

11:17.302 --> 11:22.058
I really don't like people coming to my door
unannounced while I'm working on my carving.

11:22.140 --> 11:26.270
I understand. But a stop
sign is really important.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.739
What exactly
are you carving?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.657
Hello, ma'am.
Do you love Christmas?

11:31.733 --> 11:34.452
Actually, I'm Jewish.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.201
Well, then you must
appreciate a good value.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.827
Ah, geez.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.626
If you see her,
let us know.

11:44.454 --> 11:47.424
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no!

11:47.498 --> 11:49.466
Are you kidding?
Seriously?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.716
See, you're not keeping
your head in the right position.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.514
I know that's me, but I'm not
remembering any of this.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.685
- Oh! Stupid neighbors.
- What's wrong?

11:58.760 --> 12:00.888
I can't ask for a simple signature,

12:00.970 --> 12:02.813
but it's fine for them
to build a house ...

12:02.889 --> 12:04.937
that looks like the Beverly
Hillbillies just moved in.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.939
Did you do any better?

12:07.018 --> 12:09.020
We came close
a few times, but-

12:09.103 --> 12:11.572
You're not talking about
the basketball, are you?

12:11.648 --> 12:13.776
Phil, tell me
you got some signatures.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.156
I have to be at city hall
in, like, two hours.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.080
Oh, God.
Haley, how about you?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.249
I've been busy
with my college essay.

12:21.324 --> 12:24.794
- Really? Where is it?
- It's in a rough, rough draft right now.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.917
I've been thinking that
maybe that I should-

12:26.996 --> 12:28.998
Alex has been Skyping with her
boyfriend since you left.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.755
That's so not true!

12:30.833 --> 12:34.178
Thank you, really. Thank all
of you so much for your help.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.595
Really?

12:38.716 --> 12:42.095
Sometimes those things need to
warm up, like a car. Phil, don't even!

12:42.178 --> 12:45.432
I have been out there trying to do
something good for our community ...

12:45.515 --> 12:48.644
because, let me tell you,
change doesn't just happen.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.696
It is forged
by empowered women ...

12:51.771 --> 12:55.617
like me and Norma Rae
and the lady from The Blind Side.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.990
You know what the difference is
between me and her?

12:58.069 --> 13:00.071
Blind Side's family had her back.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.539
Okay.
Huddle up, everybody.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.379
Your mother's right.

13:08.496 --> 13:12.751
She's the quarterback of this family, and
we need to protect her like Blind Side did.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.007
She just said the mom
was Blind Side.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.885
Well, she's confused. Blind Side was
the black kid who played tight end.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.807
Offensive line.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.260
Sorry.
African-American kid.

13:28.766 --> 13:32.020
There she is! Oh!

13:32.103 --> 13:34.652
¬°Ay! Stella!

13:34.731 --> 13:38.907
Ay. Thank God you found my dog.
Thank you!

13:38.985 --> 13:41.158
This is my dog.
Her name's Pinky.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.992
No, it's not. Her name is Stella. It
says right here on the tag. Look.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.951
Uh, excuse me.
Hi, sweetie.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.544
What's your name?
Blanche.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.088
Shut up.
Mitchell would die.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.758
Listen, we don't know you. You seem
like a very sweet little girl.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.838
Right now we're forced to- I can't
believe I'm saying this to you-

13:57.920 --> 13:59.843
rely on the kindness
of strangers.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.220
I'll sell her to you
for $200.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.802
That's it.
Give me my dog!

14:05.720 --> 14:07.393
Really? The little girl thinks
because she can scream,

14:07.472 --> 14:08.974
she can get away
with everything?

14:09.057 --> 14:10.900
I can scream too.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.698
What the hell sound
is that?

14:20.777 --> 14:22.950
Coyotes must've
got a cat.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.532
Jay, can we stop now?
I'm getting hungry.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.538
You know what the problem is?
You're not hungry.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.836
I had a carrot at 3:00.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.380
What if you couldn't feed your family
unless you made this next sale?

14:32.455 --> 14:34.549
What if you were gonna
lose your house?

14:34.624 --> 14:38.504
I know I was pushing the kid
hard, but here's the thing.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.556
I'm an older dad.
I'm not gonna be around forever.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.805
And I'll sleep better knowin' he's
got somethin' to fall back on.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.145
Come on, let's hit another one.
I can't do it.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.605
What? I don't have
what it takes.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.566
What kind of talk is that?
it's the truth, Jay.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.486
I'm not a great salesman.
I'm not a great businessman.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.313
I'm not you.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.946
Do you know what it's like to see all
the amazing things you've accomplished,

15:00.024 --> 15:01.742
knowing I never will?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.822
How am I supposed to live up to you?
How is anyone?

15:07.490 --> 15:11.211
Ah, so the fish weren't biting today.
So what? That's life.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.255
You tried hard,
and that's what matters.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.003
Yeah.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.715
You know, I- I actually
need some wrapping paper.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.259
Do you know where I can find some?
You don't have to do that.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.806
I want to do it.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.805
You'll never go broke
playing to a rich guy's ego.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.387
Write that down.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.564
Okay. Thank you so much,
you guys.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.605
Make a wish.
Uh, hi. Oh, sorry.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.358
Um, I'm here for
the traffic committee meeting.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.984
The meeting's
been adjourned.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.698
Yeah, um-
it's my birthday.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.650
I'm sorry.
Happy birthday.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.949
L- Just someone sent me to the wrong room,
and you guys don't meet again for months,

15:46.028 --> 15:48.872
and this is pretty much
a matter of life and death, so-

15:49.949 --> 15:52.293
Uh- Yes. Fine.
Uh, just-

15:52.368 --> 15:54.712
If you could make it quick.
This is an ice cream cake.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.664
Okay.
Actually, it's not.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.291
What?
No.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.375
Really?

16:00.543 --> 16:03.717
Oh, then we're not
in a rush, I guess, at all.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.057
No rush. Go ahead.
Great.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.181
My name is Claire Dunphy, and my family
and I live near that intersection-

16:09.260 --> 16:11.558
Why not? Why not?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.686
The freezer was broken,
and we couldn't keep it here.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.893
See, this is why I
ask you to think ahead, okay?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.070
Do you have
your 50 signatures?

16:19.145 --> 16:22.149
Uh, almost. I have 34.
But I-

16:22.231 --> 16:25.326
Oh.
That's the same thing.

16:25.401 --> 16:29.201
- Wow, I'm confused.
- It's not the same thing.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.624
No. Thirty-four is not
the same thing as 50,

16:31.699 --> 16:36.956
just like a cake is not the same
thing as an ice cream cake.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.791
Right. I get that. Sir, I'm
trying to save lives here.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.260
Mom! Mom, Mom! And I can get you
the rest of those signatures-

16:42.335 --> 16:44.008
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
Girls-

16:44.086 --> 16:46.760
We went door-to-door, and we
got you 20 more signatures.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.350
That's so sweet of you.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.469
Well, you were freaking
out at us, so- Okay.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.805
You know, let's not ruin it.
All right.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.482
Fifty-four signatures.

16:56.557 --> 17:00.653
So, what do you say? Let's start saving
lives one intersection at a time.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.277
Okay. Thank you very much. We will,
uh, take these under advisement.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.200
- Just leave them here, and thank you.
- Wait a minute!

17:06.275 --> 17:08.448
- I know what that means.
- Oh, here we go.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.530
That's Washington-speak
for "Get lost."

17:10.613 --> 17:14.117
Well, um- Wow, Phil.
What are you doing here?

17:14.200 --> 17:17.579
I'm your husband.
I'm blindsiding you.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.164
Uh-

17:19.288 --> 17:22.166
Your Honor, permission to approach.
Not a judge.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.718
I'll allow it.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.761
I'll get straight to the point,
because this is important,

17:25.836 --> 17:27.463
and that appears to be
an ice cream cake.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.345
Well, it's not!

17:29.423 --> 17:35.430
Okay. I present to you
"Stop in the Name of Life."

17:35.513 --> 17:37.766
Kick it!

17:37.848 --> 17:39.441
Clive Bixby.

17:39.517 --> 17:43.897
Can I meet you at Harry's Bar
in two minutes?

17:43.980 --> 17:46.574
Baby, I can do anything
in two minutes.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.284
Ooh.  Oh.

17:48.359 --> 17:52.080
I'll just speed through the
intersection at Greenleaf and Bristol.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.658
It's easy,
'cause there's no stop sign.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.085
I love being a kid.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.083
I have my whole life
ahead of me.

18:04.667 --> 18:12.472
- Nooooo!
- Nooooo!

18:13.593 --> 18:14.594
Okay.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.179
Well- Powerful.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.560
And unconventional.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.643
But I believe
it makes our point.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.399
So, what do you say?

18:23.477 --> 18:25.104
Well, the kid
was all right.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.939
I didn't care for you
so much.

18:27.023 --> 18:32.325
But if I were to give a stop sign to
everybody who wanted a stop sign,

18:32.403 --> 18:35.202
- this city would grind to a halt.
- I understand, sir, but-

18:35.281 --> 18:36.908
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- Allow me. Allow me!

18:36.991 --> 18:38.459
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:38.534 --> 18:40.081
I've lived with this woman
for 20 years.

18:40.161 --> 18:44.416
- Mm-hmm.
- If she wants a stop sign, there's gonna be a stop sign.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.841
Mm-hmm.
He's right.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.293
Listen to the man.
Yeah.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.346
It's deli-
No good? ¬øNo bueno?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.467
I'm home!

18:54.550 --> 18:56.598
Oh, hey.
Did you find Stella?

18:56.719 --> 18:58.721
Safe and sound.
Mmm.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.774
Oh! Hey!

19:01.849 --> 19:05.319
I did it. I left the mess.
Aren't you proud of me?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.362
I sure am.
Good for you.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.533
It wasn't easy at first,
but I just took Lily to the park,

19:10.650 --> 19:13.403
and I completely put it out of my mind.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.659
And I think I really
cleared a hurdle today.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.991
Oh, that's great.
I'm super proud of you.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.872
And you're not even tempted
to clean it up now?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.335
No!
That's great.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.878
Not now that you're home.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.877
- So, guess I better get started.
- Yeah.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.799
I don't like this.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.350
It's so gross.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.223
Oh, my God.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.221
What?
I was right.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.103
- You wanted me to clean it up.
- Oh, that's preposterous.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.603
I will not stand here and
take this from you. Oh, Cam!

19:46.686 --> 19:49.405
"Life is messy.
I love chaos."

19:49.480 --> 19:52.529
You are so full of it.
Well, you know what?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.538
That's all right. No worries. Hey,
come on, come on. Just embrace it.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.124
It's life. Oh, okay.
Now, that is gratuitous.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.790
That's Lily's favorite cereal.
Oh, it's okay. No!

20:02.868 --> 20:06.247
Relax. Hey, Lily.
Honey, come here.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.254
Sweetheart, do you want
a princess hat?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.377
Yes, Yes, yes!
Okay.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.758
Okay, that-
that is enough! No!

20:13.838 --> 20:15.886
You've proven your point!
I don't like to clean up.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.014
It's smelly, it's sticky, and after I
eat, I'm tired, I just want to lay down.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.935
And you put it off, knowing that I would do it.
Yes! Are you happy?

20:23.013 --> 20:25.812
Yes ... I ... am.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.985
Hi. I'm Ellen Roberts
from the adoption agency.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.038
I'm ... here
for the home visit.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.865
Oh!

20:42.074 --> 20:44.827
I might need
