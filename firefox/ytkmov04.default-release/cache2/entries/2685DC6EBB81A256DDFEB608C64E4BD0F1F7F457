WEBVTT

00:03.672 --> 00:07.301
"Oh, my goodness, those
hands are cold." Mm-hmm.

00:07.426 --> 00:10.429
"At least buy me dinner
first."  Boom.

00:11.388 --> 00:14.141
"Tell my wife and kids
I love them."

00:14.266 --> 00:17.477
Oh, my God. Ooh. That's
kind of dark, Morn.

00:17.561 --> 00:19.104
What?

00:19.229 --> 00:21.190
Quick. What's my favorite
hospital food? Um-

00:21.315 --> 00:23.358
Jell-O!

00:23.442 --> 00:25.527
Hey, buddy.
No, today's still good.

00:25.611 --> 00:26.862
Good for what?
Who's "buddy"?

00:26.945 --> 00:28.614
Yeah, just head
on over to the house.

00:28.739 --> 00:31.325
Whose house? Who's "buddy"? Okay.
See you in a couple.

00:31.450 --> 00:32.784
Couple of what?
Who's "buddy"?

00:32.868 --> 00:34.369
- Kenneth.
- Kenneth?

00:34.453 --> 00:35.996
Kenneth!

00:36.121 --> 00:39.082
If I had a son, I'd want him to be like
Kenneth Ploufe. You do have a son.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.668
When we first moved in here, he was
the sweet kid who lived next door.

00:41.752 --> 00:43.212
Mmm, the weird kid
who lived next door.

00:43.295 --> 00:44.838
But Phil always had
a soft spot for him...

00:44.922 --> 00:46.423
because Kenneth sort of
looked up to him.

00:46.548 --> 00:48.967
I wouldn't say hero.
And yet, you did.

00:49.051 --> 00:51.053
Well, you weren't going to.

00:51.136 --> 00:53.222
Claire's always had
some issues with Kenneth.

00:53.305 --> 00:55.807
He would stare at me
a little too long.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.893
Can you blame him?

00:57.976 --> 00:59.978
You used to dress
sexy back then.

01:01.396 --> 01:04.107
- Hey!
- Yeah!

01:04.191 --> 01:06.109
Ohh!

01:06.235 --> 01:07.736
Ahh!
Oh, wow.

01:07.819 --> 01:09.738
Oh, 10 years.
Can you believe it?

01:09.821 --> 01:10.906
Mm-mmm.  God.

01:10.989 --> 01:13.283
Ohh! I feel like we ended
that last hug too soon.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.744
Come back here.

01:15.827 --> 01:17.913
Oh, wow!
That's a lot of hugging.

01:17.996 --> 01:19.998
She's right.
Why hug, when you can-

01:20.082 --> 01:22.084
- Man shake.
- Oh, no.

01:26.630 --> 01:28.715
I'm gonna get the coffee.

01:28.799 --> 01:31.969
Man shake.
Are we sure?

01:32.052 --> 01:34.471
Mmm! Mmm.

01:34.554 --> 01:37.182
Roll up the curtain!

01:37.266 --> 01:38.267
Bing!

01:39.142 --> 01:40.852
# Hey, hey #

01:40.936 --> 01:43.021
# Hey, hey #

01:43.105 --> 01:45.190
# Hey, hey #

01:45.274 --> 01:47.276
# Hey, hey #

01:47.359 --> 01:48.360
# Hey ##

01:50.821 --> 01:52.281
I don't know what's worse,

01:52.364 --> 01:54.950
that he competes every Thanksgiving
in a pie-eating contest...

01:55.033 --> 01:56.994
or that he's nine-time runner-up.

01:57.077 --> 01:58.578
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without the contest.

01:58.662 --> 02:00.122
Yes, it would.

02:00.205 --> 02:02.916
I think I have to tell
my punkin chunkin' story.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.459
Oh, no. No, you don't have to.

02:04.543 --> 02:06.670
No, I kind of think I have to.

02:06.753 --> 02:08.255
Once, Cam and his friends...

02:08.338 --> 02:09.631
tried to slingshot a pumpkin...

02:09.715 --> 02:11.508
across a football field.

02:11.591 --> 02:13.677
Three seconds.
That's all he needs to tell that story.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.514
So the fog was rolling in over the
mountains like an ominous blanket...

02:17.597 --> 02:20.142
as we readied
the giant slingshot.

02:20.225 --> 02:22.394
You know, Lorna, the pastor's daughter,
she was nervous,

02:22.477 --> 02:24.771
because like I said,
it was after curfew.

02:24.855 --> 02:28.358
She was a goodie-two-shoe.
Only pastor's daughter I ever met that was.

02:32.487 --> 02:37.117
So we finally launch the pumpkin, and it
sails through the air, goalpost to goalpost,

02:37.200 --> 02:40.120
past the end zone,
into the parking lot,

02:40.203 --> 02:42.581
through the open roof
of Lorna's dad's car.

02:42.664 --> 02:47.461
I turn to Cody and I say, "Now what are
the chances of that landing there?"

02:47.544 --> 02:50.756
He says, "Where?",
and I say,

02:50.839 --> 02:53.592
"The sunroof
of a preacher man."

02:55.260 --> 02:58.263
Wah-wah.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.811
Okay, come on in!

03:06.063 --> 03:08.357
- Voil√†!
- Okay, what are we looking at?

03:08.440 --> 03:10.150
My centerpiece for Thanksgiving.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.402
It is wonderful.
You're so talented.

03:12.486 --> 03:14.363
I can't believe that you did this.

03:14.446 --> 03:16.823
Yeah, my juices were really
flowing on this one.

03:16.907 --> 03:18.784
I actually shot a making-of video.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.577
Hey, maybe we can watch it
later at the party.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.496
Oh, yeah. That or football.

03:23.455 --> 03:25.665
Mi amor,
I'm so proud of you.

03:25.749 --> 03:30.003
- Is there nothing in the world that you can't do?
- Centerpieces, for starters.

03:30.128 --> 03:33.006
Shh! Why do you say everything of
his is great, even if it isn't?

03:33.090 --> 03:36.176
Because I'm building him up.
That's what parents do.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.719
Too much, if you ask me.

03:37.803 --> 03:39.679
Kids cross the street nowadays,
they get a ribbon.

03:39.763 --> 03:41.390
Manny's got plenty of confidence.

03:41.473 --> 03:43.892
He just needs a little reality check
every now and then.

03:43.975 --> 03:46.061
And this thing is a horn of ugly.

03:46.144 --> 03:49.689
Shh! My mother used to
criticize everything I did.

03:49.773 --> 03:53.360
And look at me now.
I am a jumble of insecurities.

03:53.443 --> 03:54.653
I'm not getting that.

03:54.736 --> 03:56.822
Do not say a word to Manny.

03:56.905 --> 04:01.410
Fine. But trust me, if you told him
the truth, he'd thank you later.

04:01.493 --> 04:04.287
Mmm, like Claire and Mitch?
Did they thank you?

04:04.371 --> 04:06.164
Not yet.
Mmm.

04:06.289 --> 04:08.667
But it's coming.
Hmm.

04:10.127 --> 04:13.422
Oh! So many memories
in this place.

04:13.505 --> 04:15.048
Do you guys still have,
like, every cereal?

04:15.173 --> 04:17.384
We have a lot.
Yeah, of course you do.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.053
Of course you do. You only have
the greatest dad in the world.

04:20.137 --> 04:23.223
So what have you been up to? I haven't
seen you since you went off to college.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.975
Oh, you know, actually,
that didn't work out so well.

04:25.058 --> 04:28.145
I bounced around for a while. Ended
up washing dishes in New Mexico.

04:28.270 --> 04:29.521
Mmm.  Mmm.

04:29.604 --> 04:31.273
So without the benefit
of a college degree,

04:31.356 --> 04:33.442
I guess your options
were kind of limited, huh?

04:33.525 --> 04:35.110
Ease up. it's a holiday.

04:35.193 --> 04:37.362
Yeah, it was- it was-
Oh, no. No, thank you.

04:37.487 --> 04:39.281
Thank you, though, sweetie.
You're so sweet. Oh, okay.

04:39.364 --> 04:42.576
It was tough for a while, but then a
roommate and I started our own business.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.370
Oh, was that also in the dish
or cleaning industry?

04:45.454 --> 04:48.290
No. No, no, no. It was actually
a small investment company.

04:48.373 --> 04:51.626
Well, small at first. You know, we
rode the tech wave for a while,

04:51.710 --> 04:55.755
then expanded into video games,
amusement parks, sports arenas.

04:55.839 --> 04:57.507
Anything that seemed
awesome, really.

04:57.591 --> 04:59.134
I'm actually in town
to buy a blimp.

04:59.217 --> 05:01.094
Holy crow.

05:01.178 --> 05:03.805
Wow. So if y-
if you'd gone to college,

05:03.889 --> 05:07.392
you would've done all that,
just four years later- or never.

05:07.476 --> 05:10.937
Alex really needs to be picked up, sweetie.
Why don't you go get her?

05:11.062 --> 05:13.690
I want to hear more of what he
has to say about- We're leaving.

05:13.773 --> 05:17.903
Kenneth, I am so proud of you.
You really made it.

05:17.986 --> 05:19.863
Well, I did get
one pretty lucky break.

05:21.114 --> 05:23.909
Early on, I met
a very special guy...

05:23.992 --> 05:27.579
who taught me that what I
thought and said had value.

05:27.704 --> 05:30.749
Oh, you mean- Shh. Luke,
let the man talk.

05:30.832 --> 05:34.544
He encouraged me to always find
the fun and follow this thing.

05:34.669 --> 05:36.296
Your lung?
No, my heart.

05:36.379 --> 05:40.800
To this day, at every crossroad,
I ask myself one question:

05:40.884 --> 05:42.344
What would Phil Dunphy do?

05:42.469 --> 05:45.388
Record scratch!

05:45.472 --> 05:48.475
Oh, that's me buzzing.
Oh, it's Paris.

05:48.558 --> 05:50.143
She's my assistant in Tokyo.

05:50.227 --> 05:54.564
You'd think they'd know how to demo
4-D gaming graphics without my help.

05:54.648 --> 05:57.943
They don't. Hey, Luke, what
instrument does Yo-Yo Ma play?

05:58.068 --> 05:59.069
Um-
Cello!

06:00.362 --> 06:02.155
He's me.

06:02.239 --> 06:04.241
And he's spectacular.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.910
Oh, my God.

06:06.993 --> 06:09.871
Kenneth Ploufe is part owner
of a resort in the Bahamas,

06:09.955 --> 06:11.873
some cruise line...

06:11.957 --> 06:14.626
and Lacy Fair,
that lingerie company.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.045
Oh, ew! I'm wearing
one of his bras.

06:17.128 --> 06:18.838
Look, he's got a model in his lap.

06:18.964 --> 06:20.006
No way.
Look at her.

06:25.971 --> 06:27.472
This is your fault!

06:33.520 --> 06:36.189
Are you seriously
gonna stay in here all day?

06:36.273 --> 06:39.442
I can't face Mom.
If I see her, I'm gonna have to confess.

06:39.526 --> 06:42.195
Take a breather.
it's just a dent.

06:42.279 --> 06:44.906
And saying nothing
is not lying, okay?

06:44.990 --> 06:47.617
It's just letting the truth
speak for itself.

06:47.701 --> 06:49.744
This is not the time
for moral equivocation.

06:49.828 --> 06:53.039
Okay, I don't know what that means,
and also, don't tell me.

06:53.123 --> 06:56.293
You're the one who's going to lose her driving privileges.
I don't know why you're so calm.

06:56.376 --> 06:59.879
All we have to do is keep it from
Mom until she goes to the store.

06:59.963 --> 07:04.217
Then, when she sees it, she'll assume
that it happened there, which it did.

07:04.301 --> 07:05.885
So it's not really lying.

07:05.969 --> 07:07.679
Listen to you.

07:07.762 --> 07:09.723
Are you gonna be
a career criminal?

07:09.806 --> 07:11.266
You sound like Morn.

07:11.349 --> 07:13.685
I don't know what I'm gonna
do after high school.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.647
It was a supportive wah-wah.
I was trying to save the moment.

07:17.731 --> 07:19.691
There's no such thing
as a supportive wah-wah.

07:19.774 --> 07:21.776
A wah-wah, by its very nature,
is vicious and undercutting.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.945
Well, I was just trying to
salvage that story, okay?

07:24.029 --> 07:26.615
I told you not to tell it,
you told it, and it died.

07:26.698 --> 07:28.241
It did not die. it's a thinker.

07:28.325 --> 07:30.910
The only thing people were thinking was,
"Thank God this story's over."

07:30.994 --> 07:32.454
Okay, I get it.

07:32.537 --> 07:34.456
So how long have I been
embarrassing you with my stories?

07:34.539 --> 07:36.041
No, no, no, no.
You don't embarrass me.

07:36.124 --> 07:37.876
I love your stories, okay?

07:37.959 --> 07:39.753
The tractor in the swimming hole?

07:39.836 --> 07:41.379
Aunt Betty's wiglet on the piglet?

07:41.504 --> 07:44.716
Uncle Carl said you couldn't
tell 'em apart. See?

07:44.799 --> 07:46.760
Those are funny.
You have so many great ones.

07:46.843 --> 07:49.638
Well, that's farm life. Rain or shine,
there's always a bumper crop of stories.

07:49.721 --> 07:53.058
Yeah, I'm just saying maybe you take
punkin chunkin' out of the rotation.

07:53.141 --> 07:54.434
I guess you're right.
Maybe I could-

07:54.517 --> 07:57.479
Stick to the ones that really happened.
People love those.

07:57.562 --> 07:59.314
Excuse me, what?

07:59.397 --> 08:01.566
I'm-I'm just saying people
laugh more at stories that are true.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.234
Punkin chunkin'
is a true story.

08:03.318 --> 08:04.653
Truish?

08:04.736 --> 08:06.529
No, true.

08:06.613 --> 08:09.658
Really?
The length of a football field,

08:09.741 --> 08:14.162
through the sunroof of a oar that
was open in late November in Missouri?

08:14.245 --> 08:15.497
It was unseasonably warm.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.791
That explains the fog
rolling over the hill.

08:17.874 --> 08:20.418
And who's Cody, who you're
close enough to chunk with,

08:20.502 --> 08:22.837
but mysteriously only
appears in this story?

08:22.921 --> 08:25.465
Cody was K.I.A. in Desert Storm.
He's a hero.

08:28.677 --> 08:32.639
You know, all this from someone
who's never even chunked a punkin.

08:33.682 --> 08:35.058
Well, I've never
lunked a tunkin either.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.934
These aren't real things.

08:37.977 --> 08:40.230
This'll work, right?
Totally, Dad.

08:40.313 --> 08:44.526
Why have one long table when you can
use four little ones, bistro style?

08:44.609 --> 08:46.778
I bet this is how the French
do Thanksgiving.

08:46.861 --> 08:49.823
You don't mind sittin' with your Uncle
Mitch and, uh, Grandpa, do you?

08:49.906 --> 08:52.200
Anything's better
than watching Lily chew.

08:52.283 --> 08:56.287
By the way, this is the side of your old
man that Kenneth was talking about.

08:56.371 --> 08:57.914
Original.

08:57.997 --> 09:00.208
Imaginative.

09:01.876 --> 09:04.462
Fearless.

09:04.546 --> 09:09.300
So Kenneth became a gajillionaire by
asking himself, "What would Phil do?"

09:09.384 --> 09:12.011
He sure did.

09:12.095 --> 09:14.681
Where did that
come from, right?

09:14.764 --> 09:18.059
But you're you.
Why aren't We gajillionaires?

09:18.184 --> 09:21.229
Why don't you do what
Phil would do? Um-

09:21.312 --> 09:24.858
Phil, why didn't you just put
the extra leaves in the table?

09:24.941 --> 09:27.527
Tryin' to have some fun.
Be creative.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.362
One long table, honey.

09:29.446 --> 09:31.823
If it was good enough for the Last
Supper, it's good enough for us.

09:36.286 --> 09:38.496
I'm having second thoughts
about this centerpiece.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.290
Ay, no.
Hear him out.

09:40.373 --> 09:43.209
I just think if we bring it to Phil and
Claire's, we'll never see it again, right?

09:43.293 --> 09:44.335
That's the plan.

09:44.419 --> 09:46.463
Well, that'll be sad.

09:46.546 --> 09:50.258
Except maybe my sadness will inspire
me to create something even greater.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.719
Remember that collage I made that
helped us get through Katrina?

09:52.844 --> 09:54.721
Mm-hmm. You did this,
you know that.

09:54.804 --> 09:58.391
So, is this the legendary rice pilaf
we've been hearing about?

09:58.475 --> 10:00.018
Try for yourself.

10:00.101 --> 10:03.271
I used to make it every year, but it,
uh, started to upstage the turkey.

10:03.354 --> 10:04.647
Hmm.

10:04.773 --> 10:08.067
Something wrong? Not so
much wrong as... missing.

10:08.151 --> 10:10.069
It just tastes a little flat.

10:10.195 --> 10:13.114
That a fact? I just think with
the earthiness of the rice,

10:13.198 --> 10:15.492
you might want something
zesty to set it off.

10:15.575 --> 10:17.243
I think this might be a job for cumin.

10:17.368 --> 10:19.287
You know, since we're sharing
helpful criticisms- No,no,no.

10:19.370 --> 10:22.207
Nobody's sharing anything.
Manny, go change for the party.

10:22.290 --> 10:24.209
No, no, no, but I appreciate
helpful criticisms.

10:24.292 --> 10:27.378
It's, uh- it's important for me
that I hear the truth.

10:27.462 --> 10:30.507
Makes me stronger,
less of a mama's boy.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.258
Yeah, Mom, he can take it.

10:32.342 --> 10:36.888
That's what he says, but you don't
really know what he feels underneath.

10:36.971 --> 10:40.558
Some people are so sensitive
that they hear one criticism...

10:40.642 --> 10:44.729
and it kills the spark
that made them special.

10:44.854 --> 10:47.106
I think I know what's going on here.
Good.

10:47.190 --> 10:49.859
- This is about you and your morn, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

10:49.984 --> 10:52.237
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is!

10:52.320 --> 10:55.073
Manny, don't upset me anymore.
Go. Go change.

10:56.115 --> 10:57.408
What should I wear?

10:57.492 --> 10:59.452
Ay, you look good
in everything.

11:04.916 --> 11:06.417
Where you goin', Mom?

11:06.501 --> 11:10.338
I gotta run to the store.
Someone ate all the marshmallows.

11:10.421 --> 11:12.257
Hey, can I tell you something?

11:12.340 --> 11:16.219
I was thinking that maybe after New Year's
break, we could visit a couple more colleges.

11:16.302 --> 11:17.679
Seriously?

11:17.762 --> 11:19.681
I was so hard on you before.
I'm sorry.

11:19.764 --> 11:22.851
I know I'm no Kenneth. I'm gonna
need all the help that I can get.

11:22.934 --> 11:26.688
Honey, I am so proud of you.
Oh.

11:26.771 --> 11:28.273
Oh, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

11:28.356 --> 11:31.025
What's this? Oh, okay.

11:31.109 --> 11:33.111
- What are you doing?
- Oh, Uncle Mitchell's picking up the marshmallows.

11:33.236 --> 11:36.030
Then again, backpacking through Europe
could be educational in its own way.

11:36.114 --> 11:37.657
No!No,no.
No,no,no.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.450
Do you know what's
illegal in Europe?

11:39.534 --> 11:42.078
Nothing.
You're going to college.

11:42.161 --> 11:43.288
Okay, fine.

11:43.371 --> 11:45.331
Darn right, it's fine.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.126
Piece of cake.

11:49.794 --> 11:51.963
My hair's coming out!

11:53.381 --> 11:55.967
Wow, honey. I think you
could make these simpler.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.469
Just, you know, sort of do 'em
flat and on the side.

11:58.553 --> 12:00.763
Hmm. Yeah, seems like
that's how you like me.

12:00.847 --> 12:02.348
Flat and on the side.

12:02.432 --> 12:05.143
You know what? Sometimes I need
to be puffed up and frilly.

12:05.226 --> 12:07.437
Is this one of those moments
I'm gonna have to remember later...

12:07.520 --> 12:09.314
when they ask me
if there were any signs?

12:09.397 --> 12:11.065
This is what Phil would do.

12:11.149 --> 12:14.736
Make fantastic napkin origami
that startles and delights his guests.

12:14.819 --> 12:17.780
I know. But, sweetie, they're just
looking a little-

12:17.864 --> 12:20.867
Claire, you always do this.
You squelch me.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.119
You squelch me right
when I'm about to soar.

12:23.202 --> 12:24.746
Honey, you're folding napkins.

12:24.829 --> 12:26.539
You're folding my dreams.

12:26.623 --> 12:28.750
You know what Kenneth told me?

12:28.833 --> 12:30.835
The secret to his success?

12:30.919 --> 12:33.046
His whole career,
he's tried to emulate me.

12:33.171 --> 12:37.342
The only difference is, he hasn't had someone
constantly telling him what not to do.

12:37.425 --> 12:41.179
So the only reason we don't have a
blimp tethered to our mailbox...

12:41.262 --> 12:43.973
is because I'm always shooting
down your great ideas?

12:44.098 --> 12:45.183
Yeah.

12:45.266 --> 12:47.268
Let's review
the squelch pile, Phil.

12:47.352 --> 12:49.687
Let's see.
The rice pudding franchise.

12:49.771 --> 12:50.980
Works for all chewing abilities.

12:51.064 --> 12:52.398
Adult tricycles.

12:52.482 --> 12:53.566
Just try to fall off.

12:53.650 --> 12:54.734
The aspirin gun.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.236
Some people have
a hard time swallowing.

12:57.320 --> 13:02.533
And you left one out. And that, my dear,
Claire, is a Real Head-Scratcher, T.M.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.037
Action.

13:07.497 --> 13:09.791
Hey, friend.

13:09.874 --> 13:11.960
You look like you had
a rough day at the office.

13:12.043 --> 13:15.296
The stress from my job
at the robot assassin factory-

13:15.380 --> 13:17.799
is too much to take.

13:17.882 --> 13:20.259
Aw, shoot me an aspirin, pal.

13:20.343 --> 13:24.973
Maybe some day.
But until then, try this on for size.

13:25.056 --> 13:28.351
The Real Head-Scratcher features
32 patent-pending nogginizers...

13:28.434 --> 13:32.397
that gently massage your scalp
in a soothing purr of motorized delight.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.275
Ah. And it feels great.

13:36.359 --> 13:38.569
And it looks good too.

13:38.653 --> 13:40.154
It's a real life-saver.

13:40.238 --> 13:41.948
You mean a Real Head-Scratcher?

13:47.286 --> 13:49.664
I love you, Phil, but you-

13:49.747 --> 13:51.958
Stop. I love your
"I love you."

13:52.041 --> 13:53.960
I'm gettin' awful tired of your "but."

13:54.961 --> 13:56.713
I heard it.

13:56.796 --> 13:57.839
Tsk.

14:12.395 --> 14:14.188
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

14:14.272 --> 14:15.690
Happy Turkey Day.

14:15.815 --> 14:17.150
Hey, is that a new car?
Yep.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.777
- It's the best, isn't it?
- I can't take my eyes off it.

14:19.861 --> 14:21.279
You shouldn't either.

14:21.362 --> 14:22.905
Are you okay, mami?

14:22.989 --> 14:25.742
- I'm- I'm-
- Hey, guys!

14:25.825 --> 14:28.161
Now the party's started.
Come on.

14:28.244 --> 14:29.537
How are you?
Good.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.914
You disgust me.
Are you hungry?

14:31.998 --> 14:33.666
Oh, good,
it's still in one piece.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.209
You hit those potholes
pretty hard.

14:35.334 --> 14:38.046
It's like you didn't see 'em.
No, I saw 'em.

14:38.129 --> 14:39.589
Can I be honest with you, Jay?

14:39.672 --> 14:42.467
I'm getting the sense that you're
not the biggest fan of Alegria.

14:42.550 --> 14:45.428
You got a name for it now. Great.
All right, cards on the table?

14:45.511 --> 14:47.013
This is not your best work.

14:47.096 --> 14:50.308
Now look, don't get me wrong.
You're a talented kid.

14:50.391 --> 14:51.893
You're gonna be
a big success in the world.

14:51.976 --> 14:54.145
But this-
it's a swing and a miss.

14:54.270 --> 14:55.980
Well, but my mom said it was-
"It's great."

14:56.064 --> 14:58.316
Yeah, I know.
But how did she say it?

14:58.441 --> 15:00.151
What do you mean?
There's a big difference...

15:00.234 --> 15:03.488
between "It's great" and
"It's great"- You hear that?

15:03.571 --> 15:06.365
"It's great" and "It's great. "

15:06.449 --> 15:08.451
All I hear is a bunch of people
telling me I'm great.

15:08.534 --> 15:11.829
And that's a problem, because a lot of times
people will lie to you to protect your feelings,

15:11.913 --> 15:13.539
and that's not doin' you
any favors.

15:13.623 --> 15:15.083
You get a lot farther in life...

15:15.166 --> 15:17.835
if you know what you're good at
and what you're not.

15:17.919 --> 15:20.463
Now, you can handle that, right?

15:20.546 --> 15:22.882
Yeah.
Of course you can.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.425
How you doin', honey?

15:24.509 --> 15:26.010
I'm great

15:27.470 --> 15:30.098
Okay, everybody, come on. Two
minutes till dinner. Get ready.

15:30.181 --> 15:31.349
Sounds good.
All righty!

15:31.432 --> 15:33.309
Oh, wow, Manny.
What have you got there?

15:33.392 --> 15:34.769
He made a centerpiece.

15:34.894 --> 15:36.979
Oh. That's fantastic.
Stunning.

15:37.063 --> 15:38.481
It's garbage.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.609
No, no, no! What are you doing?
it's so beautiful!

15:41.692 --> 15:43.778
Stop the lies.
Jay told me the truth.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.071
What did you say?

15:45.154 --> 15:46.489
I mentioned it wasn't
his best effort.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.074
He said it was
a swing and a miss.

15:48.157 --> 15:51.577
Why? Why do you say these things, Jay?
it's like I married my mother!

15:51.661 --> 15:53.871
- Yeah, Jay, why would you do that?
- Because he's a Pritchett.

15:53.955 --> 15:56.374
But don't let these negative
nellies drag you down, Manny.

15:56.457 --> 15:58.876
Because one day, you could
have a trillion-dollar idea...

15:58.960 --> 16:00.878
that the people who supposedly
love you most-

16:00.962 --> 16:04.132
Okay, Phil. That's it.
Go get the head-scratcher.

16:04.215 --> 16:05.925
The Real Head-Scratcher, T.M.?

16:06.008 --> 16:09.762
Go get it, and let everybody else decide
how many trillions I've cost you.

16:09.846 --> 16:11.389
Way ahead of you.

16:11.472 --> 16:12.765
So what's goin' on here?

16:12.849 --> 16:15.226
We are about to make hat history.

16:15.309 --> 16:18.271
Or as I like to call it,
"hat-story."

16:18.354 --> 16:22.150
Early man had hours and hours
to scratch his weary head.

16:22.233 --> 16:26.028
But what about
today's busy times?

16:27.071 --> 16:29.198
Thank you, squire.
Great thing about this,

16:29.282 --> 16:31.659
you can wear it anywhere.

16:33.578 --> 16:34.871
Hit it, buddy.

16:34.954 --> 16:36.372
Ohh.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.834
It's like a thousand tiny angels
are line dancing on my sca-

16:39.917 --> 16:41.836
Aah.

16:41.919 --> 16:45.590
Looks like we got a slight
malfunction in a rear nogginizer.

16:45.673 --> 16:48.342
Ohh! Shut her down!
Shut her down, buddy!

16:48.426 --> 16:50.678
It's not working, Dad! My hair!
it's got my hair!

16:50.761 --> 16:52.096
Okay!

16:52.180 --> 16:54.015
Fine. I'm fine.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.934
Forgot about that feature.
it's an exfoliating scrub.

16:57.018 --> 16:58.686
Buddy, can you grab
the safety shears?

16:58.769 --> 17:00.438
You know what, Phil?
Keep it up.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.190
And I admire you and Manny.

17:02.273 --> 17:05.108
I know what it's like to stare
down skepticism from a loved one.

17:05.193 --> 17:06.819
- Cam, not now.
- Why not now?

17:06.903 --> 17:09.363
It's Thanksgiving.
Families gather. Issues come up.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.656
Only if you bring them up.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.867
It's healthy to get
things out in the open.

17:12.950 --> 17:15.243
Y'all know my punkin chunkin' story
or do you need a refresher?

17:15.368 --> 17:16.829
We've heard it.
Oh, several times.

17:16.913 --> 17:19.707
I love it,
with Cody and the friends.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.291
Yes. So you know how it ends.

17:21.375 --> 17:24.337
But the question is,
who here thinks I made that up?

17:24.420 --> 17:26.172
Oh.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.592
Oh, well. Doesn't that tell
the whole story right there?

17:29.675 --> 17:31.510
Here we have the skeptics.

17:31.594 --> 17:34.388
The dream squashers.
The Pritchetts.

17:34.472 --> 17:38.226
And here we have the dreamers,
the artists, the visionaries.

17:38.309 --> 17:40.061
Sweet Caroline!

17:40.144 --> 17:44.982
So we're supposed to believe that you make
a pumpkin fly across a football field?

17:45.066 --> 17:47.026
I can prove it right now.
Let's go to the football field.

17:47.151 --> 17:49.320
- Yes, let's do it. I'd love to end this.
- Let's settle this.

17:49.445 --> 17:51.405
Dreamers versus Pritchetts.
Yeah!

17:51.489 --> 17:53.407
Let's go!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

17:53.491 --> 17:55.660
No, no, no!

17:55.743 --> 17:58.746
I did not just cook
for eight hours...

17:58.829 --> 18:01.999
so you people could run off
to prove some asinine point...

18:02.083 --> 18:03.918
that's only gonna make
half of us feel bad.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.963
Come on!
Show a little respect.

18:10.466 --> 18:12.426
Turkey smells great,
sweetheart.

18:12.510 --> 18:15.596
Is that turkey? Because
something smells like chicken.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.890
Okay, let's settle this.
Yeah.

18:17.974 --> 18:21.018
Vamos! Vamos!
Jay, I drive!

18:22.144 --> 18:23.771
This is the coolest thing ever.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.356
Okay, I want to film.

18:25.439 --> 18:26.941
Ay, no, wait.
I want to be in it.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.693
Hey, Cam, are you sure
this is going to work?

18:28.776 --> 18:31.028
Oh, God, you sound
just like Cody.

18:31.112 --> 18:32.822
Do you think this
could launch a human?

18:32.905 --> 18:34.490
Oh, Luke.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.450
Let's do the pumpkin first.
Okay.

18:36.534 --> 18:39.745
They're havin' fun over there,
but you know it's gonna end in tears.

18:39.870 --> 18:42.707
Yeah, always does. Knock, knock.
Who's there? Physics.

18:42.832 --> 18:44.292
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.752
Who's gonna be able to launch it?
I think it should be Cam.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.380
No, I think it should be all of us!
All of us! All of us!

18:49.505 --> 18:50.840
Yeah!
Yeah!

18:50.923 --> 18:54.260
For the record, I don't
squash all of Phil's dreams.

18:54.343 --> 18:56.345
Just the ones that are,
you know, potentially fatal.

18:56.429 --> 18:58.306
I'm just trying to get
the kid ready for life.

18:58.389 --> 19:01.225
Yeah, if we didn't do this
to them, the world would.

19:01.309 --> 19:03.561
Okay, everybody
in final launching positions?

19:03.644 --> 19:05.604
Get ready to eat some crow!

19:05.688 --> 19:07.606
It is not as delicious
as it sounds.

19:08.691 --> 19:11.736
Okay. Uno, dos, tres!

19:11.819 --> 19:13.738
Three!
Yeah!

19:16.157 --> 19:19.201
What happened, Cam? I-I don't know.
I-I don't know.

19:19.285 --> 19:20.870
Can we do it again?

19:20.953 --> 19:23.789
No. We only had one punkin
and we just chunk it.

19:24.999 --> 19:27.084
Well, we were right.
Oh, my. Yeah.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.338
I'm sorry, guys-

19:30.421 --> 19:32.673
This usually feels
a little better, doesn't it?

19:32.757 --> 19:34.342
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

19:34.425 --> 19:35.885
All right, I hate to admit it,

19:35.968 --> 19:38.679
but when they put the pumpkin in, I
was kind of hoping it would work.

19:38.763 --> 19:40.598
Yeah.
Me too.

19:40.723 --> 19:42.016
Huh.  All right.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.684
Let the gloating begin.

19:43.768 --> 19:45.478
You know,
it was a pretty good try.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.271
We don't need your pity.

19:47.355 --> 19:49.065
Let's just get this stuff cleaned up.

19:49.148 --> 19:50.191
Yeah.

19:50.274 --> 19:53.694
Oh- Well,
or if maybe we, um-

19:53.778 --> 19:55.780
we launch it
from a steeper angle.

19:55.863 --> 19:58.449
Maybe if you had somebody else,
you know, helping you pull the thing.

19:58.574 --> 20:01.243
We don't have any more pumpkins.
That's the easy part.

20:01.327 --> 20:03.996
They're on every porch
up and down the block.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.456
We can handle that.
Come on, kid.

20:05.581 --> 20:06.874
Come on. Let's try one. Okay.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.167
All right.
All right!

20:08.250 --> 20:10.503
I say "punkin,"
gang says "chunkin'!"

20:10.586 --> 20:14.340
There are dreamers and
there are realists in this World.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.467
You'd think the dreamers
would find the dreamers...

20:16.550 --> 20:18.094
and the realists
would find the realists,

20:18.177 --> 20:21.555
but more often than not,
the opposite is true.

20:21.639 --> 20:23.891
Maybe if this works, we should
launch my centerpiece next.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.184
It wasn't that bad.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.977
Your rice pilaf was.

20:27.061 --> 20:28.562
Ready. Straight back.

20:28.646 --> 20:30.439
Be careful.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.858
All right.
Okay.

20:32.942 --> 20:34.860
Come on, keep going!
Keep going!

20:37.696 --> 20:39.240
You see, the dreamers
need the realists...

20:39.323 --> 20:41.409
to keep them from soaring
too close to the sun.

20:41.492 --> 20:43.869
And the realists?

20:43.953 --> 20:46.122
Well, without the dreamers,

20:46.205 --> 20:48.207
they might not ever
get off the ground.

20:51.585 --> 20:56.048
Next one's going through the-
the goal thingy. I can feel it.

20:59.677 --> 21:01.762
Now, when Lorna,
Cody and I did this-

21:01.846 --> 21:03.264
Less talkin', more chunkin'.

21:03.389 --> 21:05.099
Mom, I need to tell you something.
What is it?

21:05.182 --> 21:06.183
Ready?

21:06.267 --> 21:07.935
I distracted Haley
while she was driving...

21:08.018 --> 21:10.146
- and we dented your car.
- Fire!

21:14.233 --> 21:15.317
Ohh!

21:15.401 --> 21:16.902
Yeah!

21:16.986 --> 21:19.196
Well, girls,

21:19.280 --> 21:21.907
three more seconds, and you
would've gotten away with it.

21:21.991 --> 21:23.409
Mmm.
Mmm.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.202
Now a human?

21:25.286 --> 21:27.371
Come here, Lily.  Luke,no.

21:32.293 --> 21:33.294
