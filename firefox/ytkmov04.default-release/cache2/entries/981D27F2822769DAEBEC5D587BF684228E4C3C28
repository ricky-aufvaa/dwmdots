WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.300
One, two, three, four.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.302
And skip,
two, three, four.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.429
And turn, two, three, four.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.886
I don't like this part.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.346
Well, honey, if you spot the
wall, then you won't get dizzy.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.272
Here. Watch Daddy, okay?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.692
Ow.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.861
How cool would it be if you turned
into Wonder Woman right now?

00:18.977 --> 00:21.196
Can't even talk about it.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.366
- It's the adoption agency.
- What? Oh, my gosh, it is? It is? It is?

00:24.441 --> 00:25.909
Cam, you need
to stop doing that.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.078
Last time, they were just calling
to confirm our billing address.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.245
Hello.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.865
Uh-uh.
Uh-huh what?

00:30.948 --> 00:32.325
Yep.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.826
Really?
Really what?

00:33.909 --> 00:35.752
That mother from Calexico-
She picked us.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.746
She did?
Uh-huh.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.002
She-She went into early labor.
She's having the baby today.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.670
She is?
Uh-huh.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.343
We have to go
to Calexico right now.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.713
We do? Just assume everything
I say is the truth.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.430
Okay-
Okay-

00:47.506 --> 00:49.304
O-Okay, yes.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.223
- Well, thank you so much.
- Okay, bye.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.350
Um, we're getting a baby today.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.224
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.942
Ohh!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.894
What do we do
about Lily's recital?

01:00.978 --> 01:05.154
Um- Well, you know what?
We'll just sit her down.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.155
We'll tell her.
We'll give her a Popsicle.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.577
She'll be fine.
Yeah.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.992
We have to do this. Okay, okay.
Yeah, you're right.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
I'm gonna go dig up
the old car seat. And listen.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.955
Let's just take a deep breath
before we tell anyone, okay?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.377
Yeah.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.205
Jay, Manny! Good news.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.667
Mitch and Cam are getting
a new baby today.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.126
Really? That's fantastic.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.132
And he's Latino!

01:26.211 --> 01:28.213
How's that giant fence
workin' out for you?

01:30.173 --> 01:31.925
It's Claire.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.933
Hello. Did you hear?

01:37.556 --> 01:40.275
- Hey, Claire.
- You are driving to some California border town ...

01:40.350 --> 01:42.899
to adopt a baby, and I have
to hear about it from Gloria?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.314
I was outside
for two minutes.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.741
I kept it in as long as I could.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.693
We're having a baby!

01:50.736 --> 01:52.784
# Hey, hey #

01:52.863 --> 01:54.865
# Hey, hey #

01:54.948 --> 01:56.916
# Hey, hey #

01:56.992 --> 01:58.915
# Hey, hey #

01:58.994 --> 02:00.086
# Hey ##

02:01.830 --> 02:03.298
What the-

02:03.373 --> 02:04.841
What?
What the heck is that?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.463
We're back.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.637
We got Alex
the cutest prom dress.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.464
Show your dad.  Hey.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.390
Well, I don't like how far
down that zipper goes,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.514
but on the plus side,
it looks water-resistant.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.688
I can't believe Haley's not
going to the prom and Alex is.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.936
What's that supposed
to mean?

02:20.015 --> 02:22.564
I know I keep saying it, Haley,
but you should be going.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.146
It's a major moment in a teenager's
life, and you're missing it.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.855
Proms are lame.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.737
It's just an excuse for dressed-up dorks
to ride limos and hump each other.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.443
Okay.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.575
- Now I don't like the idea of Alex going.
- Sweetie, I think we're fine.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.539
it's Alex.
What's that supposed to mean?

02:36.615 --> 02:37.992
It means you're a geek.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.497
You know what?
You know what?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.328
I might just
go crazy tonight and ...

02:41.411 --> 02:43.459
and-and hook up all over him.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.751
- Okay.
- Why are you laughing? That's not funny.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.836
I'm not even gonna
wear my glasses.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.089
Ohh. I
feel better now.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.470
All right.
I'm going to the mall.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.428
Um, we need to talk, honey.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.853
We're worried about you.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.809
You haven't heard back from
the college that wait-listed you,

03:03.892 --> 03:05.314
and all the rest
of your friends have,

03:05.394 --> 03:07.146
and now you're just
wasting time at the mall.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.233
For your information, I have already
filled out and dropped off ...

03:10.315 --> 03:12.192
my community college
application.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.905
And plus also, I'm going to the mall
because I have a job interview.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.077
What?
Really?

03:18.156 --> 03:20.375
My guidance counselor
suggested I take a gap year.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.202
You know, a year between
high school and college ...

03:22.285 --> 03:26.461
where you take some courses, have some
life experiences and get inspired.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.793
And obviously work at The Gap.

03:30.752 --> 03:34.052
The first step in plane
building- organize the parts.

03:34.131 --> 03:39.012
You got your power plant, you got your
fuselage, you got your control surfaces.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.392
What's that?
it's charcuterie.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.690
You got your prosciutto,
your pancetta, your salami.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.812
That's charcuterie?

03:44.891 --> 03:47.019
I've been avoiding that
on menus for years.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.321
They're killing
themselves with that name.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.315
They're here!
They're here.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.156
Hi.
Hi.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.033
Thank you so much for doing this.
Thank you, thank you.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.122
Of course.
So her recital's at 6:00.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.370
That's the address.
Here's her outfit.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.374
This is our camcorder. Get the whole
show and some backstage color.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.706
- Guys, you want to take our charcuterie for the road?
- Bup, bup, bup.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.131
They're good.
We may need that.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.250
Hello.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.927
Yeah, um- Hold on one second.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.426
I think it's the baby's family.
They're speaking Spanish. I-

04:15.505 --> 04:17.098
Hola. Soy Cameron.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.676
¬øC√©mo est√°?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.636
Uh, excuse me, could you-

04:20.719 --> 04:22.392
Could you slow down
just a little bit?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.556
What does "fren√©tico" mean?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.103
It's when they-
Or just let her do it.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.477
Yeah. There you go.
Okay. ¬øAl√≥?

04:28.602 --> 04:31.105
S√≠, s√≠. Yo la puedo a yudar.
I was doing fine.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.782
He thinks he's some sort of an expert
because for the past two weeks ...

04:33.899 --> 04:36.152
- he's been watching this ridiculous Spanish soap opera.
- Fire and Ice?

04:36.234 --> 04:38.532
Don't say a word about the
ending of last night's episode.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.035
Gl-Gloria watches that.
You'll ruin it for her.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.493
S√≠ van a ester esperando
su llamada, muchis√≠mas gracias.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.954
It was the mother's sister,
Juanita.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.415
She said that she doesn't
know the exact hospital yet,

04:49.539 --> 04:52.634
but that she will call you, like, in the next hour.
Oh, thank you, Gloria.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.212
I hate to ask this of you, but
would you mind coming with us'?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.297
We need someone who actually
knows how to speak Spanish.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.471
Fr√≠o. Muy fr√≠o.
Ay, yes, of course.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.848
I would love to.
Thank you, thank you.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.101
I'm gonna grab my stuff,
and we go, okay?

05:05.180 --> 05:07.148
All right, sweetheart.
All right. Come here.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.318
Mmm! Daddy's gotta go, okay?
All right.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.486
We're so sorry we're missing
your recital, sweetie.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.030
But you know what? You're getting
a brand-new baby brother.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.649
Come on. Come on.
Mwah!

05:15.732 --> 05:17.234
Okay. All right.
Breathe, breathe.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.695
Jay, Manny,
I'll see you later, okay?

05:21.488 --> 05:22.956
What just happened here?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.624
I have to go
to the bathroom.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.368
She's talking to you.
You wanna take that?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.923
Always keep the rhythm
in your feet.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.967
Then we're gonna add just a little
party in the shoulders, all right?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.386
Now let's get those arms goin'.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.508
No. no, no, no.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.214
Arms down here says,
"I'm white and I'm sorry,"

05:39.339 --> 05:42.718
but arms up here says, "You
don't know what I am." I don't.

05:42.801 --> 05:46.522
You're never gonna believe it. You're never gonna believe it.
You're never gonna believe it.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.816
Guess who got a job? I did.
Oh, shoot, I just told you.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.527
Oh, honey, congratulations.
That's amazing.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.025
You got a job.
And what is all this?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.654
I stopped by the grocery store
to get some stuff for dinner.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.450
You know where
the grocery store is?

05:59.526 --> 06:02.871
Yes, Mother. I'm celebrating by making
dinner for me and Dylan tonight.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.619
Would you and Dad
like to join us?

06:05.574 --> 06:07.542
What's happening?
I don't know.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.712
Tonight, at dinner, I'm telling my
parents the biggest news of all.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.961
After graduation,
I'm moving in with someone.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.213
And his name is me.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.893
Watch me dance. Honey, you don't
need to practice anymore.

06:24.968 --> 06:28.563
The turning, the jumping, the
little bird thing- You've got it.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.433
What's this? Sweetie, please
don't play with the pieces.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.393
I've told you,
they're very delicate.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.023
What are you building?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.731
It's a model of a plane that
was built for Amelia Earhart.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.533
Why? Because she wanted
to fly around the world.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.620
Why? Because she probably needed
to get away from her kids.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.739
Why? You know how to stop this?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.699
I'm on it.

06:47.782 --> 06:51.878
Lily, we really need you to let us
concentrate for a few minutes, okay?

06:51.995 --> 06:55.670
Your hair is weird.
Um, now I'm flustered.

06:56.833 --> 07:01.054
Oh, you look adorable.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.972
Adorable? I'm not a puppy.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.932
Honey, it was meant as a compliment.
Claire, I got this.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.476
Honey, you look super sexy.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.019
Eww.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.721
Well, we tried everything.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.431
Oh, good-bye.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.016
Wait, wait, wait.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.726
We want to meet
this Casanova.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.528
Oh, no. Parents aren't really his scene.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.107
Alex, open the door.
We are going to get a picture.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.487
Fine.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.618
You look flawless.
Thanks.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.290
Did I not say coral
was the color for you?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.789
Look what it does
for your skin.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.954
Hi.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.380
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.550
Yes, my bad-boy prom date
is gay.

07:38.625 --> 07:42.175
He just doesn't know it yet,
so I'm basically his beard.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.181
Pre-beard.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.803
His stubble.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.806
Okay, say cheese.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.262
Cheese.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.347
Okay, now one with flash.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.646
Cheese!

07:55.725 --> 07:57.352
Okay, I think
you got the picture.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.437
Well, you guys have fun.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.149
Do you want me to
touch up your hair, honey?

08:02.232 --> 08:03.734
Oh, no, I'm good.

08:06.403 --> 08:10.203
Ay, please. Stop driving the car like a snake.
it's making me nauseating.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.535
If you want to switch places, there's
plenty of room to stretch out back here.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.666
That's why we traded our old
Prius in for the new one.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.213
You know, bigger family,
bigger back seat.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.632
You can fit two car seats and a
prize-winning pig back there.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.673
Please don't put a pig
in the backseat with our children.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.722
I'm not being literal. it's a unit
of measurement we use on the farm.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.471
You know, like,
"That bed's a double-pigger."

08:28.550 --> 08:31.224
Oh, uh, sorry. Maybe think
about something else.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.270
You know, I missed Fire and Ice on Monday.
What happened?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.690
My guess is a bunch
of ridiculous plot turns ...

08:35.765 --> 08:38.018
done by overwrought actors who
are impossibly good-looking.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.861
Don't listen to him. Nothing, really.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.359
Antonio hired a hooker
to murder his father ...

08:42.438 --> 08:44.066
so that he can
get back the money,

08:44.149 --> 08:48.655
but the hooker ended up being his long-lost
sister, the former beauty queen.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.660
Oh! Well,
I stand uncorrected.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.366
A y, please.
Just drive straighter.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.951
Oh, sorry.
Are my pinkies up again?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.287
They do that when I get excited.
Down, girls.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.295
Well, Alex should be hitting the
dance floor right about now.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.883
Must be fun.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.460
Really, Dad, let it go.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.716
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I'm just sad you're missing it.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.139
I can still totally
picture my prom night.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.808
My date was Angela Wilkins.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.263
My dad dressed as a limo driver
and spoke with a British accent.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.019
Even announced our arrival.

09:17.098 --> 09:21.228
Sir Philliam
Dunphy and the Lady Wilkins.

09:21.311 --> 09:24.235
All the cool kids were totally laughing with us.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.942
I am just so glad
we met after that.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.447
Oh.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.279
Me too.
Yeah.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.285
Wonder whatever happened
to Angela.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.913
- You don't know?
- I haven't seen her in over 20 years.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.120
But that's what's special
about prom.

09:38.203 --> 09:42.083
No matter what, the Lady Wilkins
and I will always have that night.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.042
Wow.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.877
Oh, no, no, no.
We got this.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.256
We'll clean.  Oh.
Uh, you're cleaning up?

09:49.339 --> 09:52.388
What kind of day is this?
Cam and Mitch get a new son.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.603
We get a new daughter. This
is really fun, you guys.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.022
Yeah. Next time,
let's do it at our place.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.647
I'm in.
Just give me a heads-up.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.398
Our place?

10:02.519 --> 10:06.615
Uh, what- Um, well, since
I have a job now ...

10:06.689 --> 10:09.283
and I'm going
to community college,

10:09.359 --> 10:11.657
Dylan and I were
thinking that, you know,

10:11.736 --> 10:14.330
we would get
an apartment together.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.407
What?
Are you doing sex?

10:16.533 --> 10:19.127
Luke, can we have
a minute, please? Um-

10:19.202 --> 10:21.455
Listen, I know
that you're concerned,

10:21.538 --> 10:25.634
but I'm designing T-shirts now,
and they're gonna be huge.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.676
Also medium and small.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.757
Dylan, would you excuse us for
moment so we can talk to Haley?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.308
Sure.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.886
But you stay.
I'll go.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.145
Hi. "Buenos noches."

10:42.225 --> 10:44.444
We're looking for, uh-
English?

10:44.519 --> 10:46.613
Uh, Juanita.
We're looking for Juanita.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.730
Hola.
Hi.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.236
¬øMitchell y Cameron?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.613
She says,
"Hello, Mitch and Cameron."

10:51.693 --> 10:54.537
- I think we got that.
- You brought me here.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.832
El beb√© naci√≥ hace media hora y se
encuentra perfectamente de salud.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.534
Siete libras
con cuatro onzas.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.417
Es hermoso. Tiene el pelo grueso
y los ojos grandee y cafecitos.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.170
Ay, qu√© bueno.
Did you get that too?

11:06.291 --> 11:08.760
Yeah. Lot of it. Mm-hmm.
Uh, just-just tell us.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.681
The baby was born half hour ago,
that he's in perfect health.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.008
He was seven pounds,
four ounces,

11:15.091 --> 11:17.560
with thick hair and brown eyes.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.228
That's so good. Yes.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.849
- Juanita.
- Padre.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.434
¬øQu√© hace usted ac√°?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.064
Ven ac√°.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.564
Vengo con un serio aviso
mi ni√±a.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.365
- Perdone.
- Gloria, what's going on?

11:31.441 --> 11:34.786
I don't know. The priest comes
with grave warning.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.280
That can't be good.
Shh!

11:36.362 --> 11:38.114
Something about the grandmother.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.666
- She's sick. -  Ohh.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.459
- But now she's better.
- Oh.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.003
- And now she knows!
- Knows what?

11:44.078 --> 11:47.082
T√∫. T√∫ hiciste esto.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.042
T√∫ le dijiste a mi abuela
acerca del beb√©.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.672
¬øPor qu√© har√≠a yo tal cosa?

11:50.752 --> 11:54.507
Porque Carlos me escogi√≥ a m√≠
en vez de a ti coma su amante.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.887
What was that for? The nurse
stole her grandmother's almonds.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.815
No. The nurse is mad at Juanita
because Juanita stole her lover,

12:03.890 --> 12:09.112
and Juanita is mad at the nurse because the
nurse told her grandmother about the baby.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.315
Our baby?

12:27.830 --> 12:30.424
We're both thinking it.
I'm just gonna say it.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.094
Lily's dance is not up to the
standard of what we just saw.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.592
In my head,
I'm golfing right now.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.219
Hi, Mr. Pritchett.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.426
I'm Lily's dance teacher, Lucy.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.854
We have a little bit of an issue.
Lily doesn't want to perform.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.556
Oh, the poor thing.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.399
You get the kid. I'll get the car.
Oh, no.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.102
It's really important for Lily's
self-esteem that she go on.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.812
I think one of you
should talk to her.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.613
You know she stinks, right?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.236
And I think it should be you.

13:01.656 --> 13:07.163
Lily, your teacher tells me you
don't want to dance. Is that true?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.842
But you were so good back at the
house when you were practicing.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.885
I want to go home,
to my house.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.759
Oh, to your house, huh?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.512
Are you sad
your dads aren't here?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.597
Yeah.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.304
Well, I know they're sad
to miss this,

13:24.387 --> 13:26.230
but they're getting you
that baby brother.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.979
That's good, right?

13:29.892 --> 13:32.361
You know, honey,

13:32.437 --> 13:35.941
your dads are gonna love you just
as much when you get this brother.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.528
Trust me. I first had your Aunt
Claire and then your dad came along,

13:39.610 --> 13:43.035
and I loved them just the same,
no matter what he tells you.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.582
You believe me?

13:45.783 --> 13:47.285
Close enough.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.087
So what do you say? You gonna go
out there and dance for everybody?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.665
No.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.547
Honey, there must be something
I can do to get you out there.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.054
Come dance with me, Grandpa.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.631
Now, honey,
that's not gonna happen.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.967
How about I give you 50 bucks?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.802
I don't see why I can't do this.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.728
I'm totally
getting my life together.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.807
Allow me, if you will,
to paint an accurate picture ...

14:08.931 --> 14:11.150
of this life you think
you want, okay? Yeah.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.102
Um, at first, it's a blast.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.441
Buying a dish rack, hanging a sheet
up to turn one room into two.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.619
Allen-wrenching a bookcase called a Njarnk
because you couldn't afford the Sklurg.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.744
But then- Then those
bills start rollin' in,

14:25.823 --> 14:28.326
so you gotta pick up some
extra shifts, and suddenly-

14:28.451 --> 14:31.751
Uh-oh, what's that? You're pregnant.
You should've been safe.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.877
Oh, and you're stressed
and exhausted.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.381
You've got a garage filled
with unsold huge T-shirts.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.212
And, honey, if you think
this kind of stress ...

14:39.295 --> 14:44.017
is not going to take its toll on that
body and that face, think again.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.220
Good-bye,
beautiful skin.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.430
Farewell, silky hair.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.813
And hello, Alex's hand-me-downs,
'cause you can't afford to shop.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.194
Good one.
Mm-hmm.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.906
Do you think that this
is gonna work out?

14:58.981 --> 15:00.483
Yes.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.159
Well, for my parents,
I mean.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.613
For you, no.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.747
God.

15:06.823 --> 15:10.498
I just want to live
with Haley so bad.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.250
It's like I missed all this
time with her in Wyoming,

15:13.329 --> 15:16.003
and I thought I was gonna
lose her again to college.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.302
Don't worry. I got your back, buddy.
That's not gonna happen.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.220
What does that mean?

15:21.295 --> 15:23.138
Dylan, shut the door.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.553
The bedroom door.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.645
Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.606
We're very confused. Can somebody
please just tell us what's happening?

15:39.730 --> 15:43.906
Somebody told the grandmother about the
baby, and she wasn't supposed to know.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.330
If you ask me,
it was the sexy priest.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.123
Enough!

15:49.198 --> 15:51.621
It wasn't the priest.
It was me.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.499
Eduardo.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.830
¬°Ay!
¬°Ay!

15:54.912 --> 15:57.961
- What's happening?
- Yes, I am alive.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.633
And I may be
just a ranch hand,

15:59.709 --> 16:02.132
but I'm the one that told
your abuela about the baby.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.932
I told her because I swore to your
mother to look after your family.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.977
Your mother was my lover.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.187
¬øQu√©?

16:11.262 --> 16:13.515
Ay, wait a minute. Now I go
from English to Spanish.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.023
- Que √©l no est√° muerto-
- Can we please just see our baby?

16:17.101 --> 16:18.603
¬°No!

16:20.229 --> 16:21.981
¬°Abuela!

16:22.064 --> 16:25.284
¬øC√©mo te atre ves
a ocultar esto de m√≠?

16:25.359 --> 16:30.581
El beb√© es mi familia
y no va a ser educado
por extra√±os.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.996
She's saying that she's
going to raise the baby.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.583
No.
Cam.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.762
Come here. Come on.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.759
Guess what.
Suddenly you're 60 years old,

16:49.842 --> 16:53.062
wandering toothless and alone in
a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.107
Wait a second. How did Dylan
get the nuclear codes again?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.684
During the robot wars.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.940
I think your father may have gotten
a little bit off track here.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.898
Honey, listen. The point is,
the choices you make today-

17:02.980 --> 17:06.029
No, the point is that it doesn't
have to turn out so bad.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.031
She's right.
It doesn't.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.364
Luke?
This came yesterday.

17:11.489 --> 17:15.665
What is it? It's from that college.
You got in, Haley.

17:15.785 --> 17:16.786
Oh, my God.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.835
You got into college?
What? That's amazing!

17:19.914 --> 17:21.665
Oh!

17:21.749 --> 17:23.672
It came yes-
Yesterday?

17:23.751 --> 17:25.845
Luke, why were you
hiding this?

17:25.920 --> 17:29.174
- I don't know.
- Do you not want her to go to college?

17:29.257 --> 17:32.056
- I don't care.
- Oh, you're gonna miss me.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.932
Shut up. I am not.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.684
I'm never telling you
anything again.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.233
Sorry, little dude,
but she's gotta go to college.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.561
Even if that means
that she can't live with me.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.146
Oh, Dylan.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.903
Could you do one thing
for me though?

17:45.982 --> 17:47.655
Could you take me
to your prom?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.074
Really?
Yeah.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.372
I mean, if you go off to college
and you don't come back here,

17:53.447 --> 17:54.915
I want you to remember me.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.369
I want to be
your Angela Wilkins.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.587
Oh. Mom?

17:59.662 --> 18:02.666
- Yes? - Can I borrow that purple
dress I said you were too old for?

18:02.790 --> 18:05.885
Mmm, in spite of that, yeah.
Yeah.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.717
Mr. D.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.341
Do you have a tuxedo I could borrow?
Yeah, sure.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.893
I mean, it's the tux I got married
in, so it's double-breasted.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.595
Perfect.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.180
So am I.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.349
Okay.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.982
I'm going to get something
for my stomach.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.121
Come on, swipe.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.448
Swipe!

18:35.531 --> 18:37.533
Mitchell, I need your help.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.042
It won't swipe, and I'm in no
condition to "see cashier."

18:41.120 --> 18:42.963
Mitchell.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.291
Mitchell?

18:44.373 --> 18:46.671
Mitchell?
Mitch- Mitchell!

18:46.751 --> 18:48.594
Where are you going?

18:48.669 --> 18:50.137
I'm just sick of it, Cam.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.135
Mitchell, come back here
and talk to me.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.808
There are coyotes out here
a-and meth addicts.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.511
Every time, Cam-

18:56.594 --> 18:59.814
Every time someone says that we're
getting a baby, I get my hopes up.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.563
And then- And then,
when it all falls apart, I-

19:02.642 --> 19:04.610
We just have to go through
the whole thing again.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.278
And then meanwhile,

19:06.354 --> 19:09.528
the child that we do have is at a
recital, and we're missing it.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.985
I know.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.036
I'm as frustrated as you are.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.580
Are you?

19:16.656 --> 19:19.330
Because I don't- I don't know how
much more of this I can take.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.285
I am- I am so tired ...

19:22.286 --> 19:24.084
and-and just disappointed.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.546
I'm just tired.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.759
Let's take a break.

19:38.052 --> 19:41.022
- Really?
- It must be exhausting,

19:41.097 --> 19:43.850
always keeping it together
for the both of us.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.866
And I'm tired too.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.494
I think I'm lying on a rock.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.449
I'm lying
next to my rock.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.289
There-S certain moments
in life that you never forget-

20:07.957 --> 20:11.587
like when held Manny in my
arms for the very first time.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.226
I was nervous.
I didn't know what I was doing.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.052
What do you think?

20:20.136 --> 20:21.763
You guys look amazing.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.063
Oh, my little girl.

20:23.139 --> 20:26.018
I was so excited to see him grow up.
Have fun, man.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.024
She's asleep.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.730
I tell you, kid,
I'm too old for this.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.861
You and me both.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.318
And the more he becomes
the little man I know today,

20:35.401 --> 20:39.531
the more I know
I would do it all over again.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.744
Which is good, 'cause I'm going
to do it all over again.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.421
Turns out
that I wasn't carsick.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.211
I'm pregnant.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.422
Okay, Luke, let's see what
else you've been hiding from us.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.975
Okay, fine. Here's a bill for the
birdhouse I blew up at the dude ranch.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.677
You blew up a birdhouse?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.684
Let's hold all questions
until the end.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.562
Here's that jury duty thing for
the day we went to Disneyland.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.893
- I didn't want you to cancel the trip.
- Good call.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.104
Here's a coupon
for a gun range for Mom.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.440
- I don't know what that's about.
- I don't know either.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.990
Report card.
Mm-hmm.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.284
Report card.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.111
Notice from the city
to take down the tree house ...

21:19.195 --> 21:21.072
or be fined $25 a day.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.328
Report card.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.035
Red light ticket from
when me and Manny stole that-

21:31.415 --> 21:32.416
