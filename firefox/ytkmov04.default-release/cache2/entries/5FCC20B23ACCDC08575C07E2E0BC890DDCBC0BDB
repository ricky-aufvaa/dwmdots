WEBVTT

00:03.255 --> 00:06.508
Oh, thank you so much for the donation.
I wish I could do more.

00:06.633 --> 00:09.511
It's just a bunch of old, out-of-date clothes.
Oh, I'm sure it's great.

00:10.971 --> 00:12.973
Three weeks ago,
our neighbors, the Rands,

00:13.056 --> 00:16.143
lost their house and
everything they own in a fire.

00:16.226 --> 00:18.228
Fortunately,
nobody was hurt.

00:18.312 --> 00:20.856
And fortunately, they're friends
with Wonder Woman over here.

00:20.939 --> 00:22.441
I'm hardly Wonder Woman.

00:22.524 --> 00:26.653
She mobilized the community to donate
clothes, furniture, appliances.

00:26.778 --> 00:29.740
All to help them start over in their
new rental- Which you found them.

00:29.823 --> 00:33.160
I'm no Wonder Woman.
Rand-Aid was her idea.

00:33.243 --> 00:35.787
Wasn't my idea
to call it Rand-Aid.

00:35.871 --> 00:38.999
Okay, fine.
I'm Wonder Woman.

00:39.124 --> 00:42.044
Terrible tragedy.
They're our closest friends.

00:42.127 --> 00:44.630
We know them. Uh, Manny and
their son Reuben are tight.

00:44.713 --> 00:46.381
In fact, I put in one of their closets.

00:46.465 --> 00:49.218
Not that it matters, but it was
the only structure to survive the fire.

00:49.301 --> 00:51.345
Par favor,
don't even say that word.

00:51.428 --> 00:53.889
In my country, it is considered
very, very bad luck...

00:53.972 --> 00:55.724
when your house burns down.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.062
Th-They lived
a block away from us.

01:00.145 --> 01:03.565
Smoke was everywhere. I was so
upset, I couldn't sleep for days.

01:03.649 --> 01:05.901
Of course, Mitchell
won't let me take anything.

01:05.984 --> 01:08.111
Well, Cam, we both know why.

01:08.195 --> 01:12.199
Some people have been known to sleepwalk
or even sleep-drive on that medication.

01:13.158 --> 01:14.701
Cam's reaction is much worse.

01:18.872 --> 01:20.165
Oh! No!

01:23.919 --> 01:27.589
Oh, God! Oh, God.

01:27.673 --> 01:29.549
I sleep-clown.

01:32.344 --> 01:34.137
- Dad, you're gonna kill yourself.
- I got it.

01:34.221 --> 01:35.555
We're on a schedule here.

01:35.639 --> 01:37.099
I still have to pick up the truck.

01:37.182 --> 01:38.934
If you want him to
stop lifting things,

01:39.017 --> 01:42.354
put all this in grocery bags
and turn the TV on to a football game.

01:42.437 --> 01:44.856
Oh, take this phone
away from me.

01:44.940 --> 01:46.108
Why?

01:46.191 --> 01:48.360
Two of our best brokers left
to start their own agency,

01:48.443 --> 01:50.237
and the office gossip is flying.

01:50.362 --> 01:53.115
But I want today to be about the Rands,
and if I have this-

01:53.198 --> 01:56.451
Oh, my God. Those guys took two
secretaries and the tube dude with them.

01:56.535 --> 01:58.036
Who's the tube dude?

01:58.120 --> 02:00.539
You know, the blowy guy that attracts
all the attention. This guy.

02:01.540 --> 02:02.874
Ah, sÃ­, I've seen him.

02:02.958 --> 02:05.669
He goes down with the air,
and then he shakes up.

02:05.794 --> 02:08.130
He goes down in the air, and then
up- You almost got it. Yeah.

02:08.213 --> 02:10.799
- And then goes down.
- Hi, hi. Sorry.

02:10.882 --> 02:13.760
We would've been here sooner, but
this one had a wardrobe crisis.

02:13.844 --> 02:16.596
You know, it's a somber occasion,
and all my tops are too joyful.

02:16.722 --> 02:18.348
- You do not want our problems.
- No.

02:18.473 --> 02:20.058
Here, Jay, let me- No, I got it.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.810
Dad! Ah! My back'

02:22.644 --> 02:24.021
No, Jay,
that's not quite it.

02:24.104 --> 02:26.940
Remember, you got air blowin' through you.
So it's more like-

02:27.024 --> 02:29.067
And then out and then out.

02:29.901 --> 02:31.862
# Hey, hey #

02:31.945 --> 02:33.947
# Hey, hey #

02:34.031 --> 02:35.991
# Hey, hey #

02:36.074 --> 02:37.701
# Hey, hey #

02:37.784 --> 02:38.952
# Hey ##

02:41.580 --> 02:43.165
Leave me alone.
I'm fine.

02:43.248 --> 02:45.083
I've gotta pick up that truck.

02:45.167 --> 02:48.628
- I'd be happy to get the truck.
- I don't think so. it's a pretty big truck.

02:48.712 --> 02:52.966
Oh. Is it- Is it bigger than the combine
I've been driving since I was 12 years old?

02:53.050 --> 02:54.843
Or the windrow tractor
with MacDon header...

02:54.926 --> 02:57.888
that I drove to and parallel parked
at my high school prom?

02:57.971 --> 02:59.264
Hmm?

02:59.348 --> 03:01.058
At least something
got plowed that night.

03:01.141 --> 03:02.351
Heard that.

03:02.434 --> 03:05.145
- Son of a bitch!
- Your low back is in spasm, Jay.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.897
I can massage that
out for you.

03:07.022 --> 03:08.482
I'm fine. Dad, you don't
know what you're missing.

03:08.607 --> 03:11.735
Phil is a magician.
And a licensed masseur.

03:11.818 --> 03:16.198
Before I heard the siren song of residential
real estate, I was bitten by the rub bug.

03:16.281 --> 03:18.408
No, he's-he's amazing.
I had this knot in my leg.

03:18.492 --> 03:20.160
Two minutes with Phil,
and it was gone.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.245
I'm sorry, but I think you might
have a higher tolerance...

03:22.329 --> 03:24.331
for a man's hands
on your body than I do.

03:24.414 --> 03:25.624
Charming.

03:25.707 --> 03:28.377
Ay, don't be an idiot.
Let Phil help you.

03:28.460 --> 03:31.296
- Fine.
- Great! I'll just go get the room ready.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.715
You'll be surprised
with what these hands can do.

03:33.799 --> 03:36.426
Really? Can they drive a Bobcat
skid-steer with a bucket grapple...

03:36.510 --> 03:38.011
through a school hallway
on a dare?

03:38.095 --> 03:40.722
Because these can, and have.

03:43.642 --> 03:44.684
Poor Reuben, huh?

03:44.768 --> 03:46.728
Having to rebuild
his whole life at age 12.

03:46.812 --> 03:49.064
Yeah. That blows.

03:49.147 --> 03:51.817
I know we're both shaken up,
but let's watch the language.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.611
Okay, put this in a safe place.
it's for Reuben.

03:54.694 --> 03:58.198
It's one of those, um, how do you say again?

03:58.281 --> 04:01.451
Is that the helicopter with the camera
in it that you control with your phone?

04:01.535 --> 04:03.453
The one I asked for?

04:03.537 --> 04:05.997
Okay, when your house burn down,
you get one of these.

04:06.081 --> 04:08.375
No, don't burn your house down.

04:10.001 --> 04:13.296
How lucky is Reuben?
So lucky.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.298
You know what? I say we take this
thing out and see how she flies.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.135
I don't know.
My morn got it for Reuben.

04:18.260 --> 04:21.762
Oh, so now he won't even share his toys?
He never does.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.015
Screw that guy!
Yeah!

04:25.058 --> 04:27.477
You're a terrible influence.
You need me.

04:29.646 --> 04:32.649
Claire, in case
you want to add something,

04:32.732 --> 04:36.570
I put the box of dresses outside, and
this is the box of snicker-snackers.

04:36.653 --> 04:39.239
Mmm.
Thanks.

04:39.322 --> 04:42.826
Mitchell, we did have something
to add to this box of, um,

04:42.909 --> 04:44.911
snicker-snackers.

04:44.995 --> 04:47.747
- What?
- English is not her first language.

04:47.831 --> 04:51.042
- She's just trying to help.
- Mitchell, come on. You can't do that.

04:51.126 --> 04:54.171
You can't just change the rules.
it's what we do.

04:54.254 --> 04:57.757
When Gloria says something silly,
we innocently laugh behind her back.

04:57.841 --> 04:59.301
Come on. She's had a
rough week, all right?

04:59.384 --> 05:01.803
She's really worried about tia
Maria Cecilia and that surgery.

05:01.887 --> 05:03.847
Oh, and then she lost
her cell phone at Pilates.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.308
- How do you know this?
- We have coffee.

05:06.391 --> 05:09.144
Oh, "have." So when did
this become, like, a thing?

05:09.227 --> 05:12.230
What's the big deal? We're friends.
I like Gloria.

05:12.314 --> 05:15.942
Uh, it's no big deal. It's-
I have nothing against her.

05:16.026 --> 05:17.527
I just think- Oh!

05:20.822 --> 05:23.950
All right. So before you get all
judgey, I gave her that vase.

05:24.034 --> 05:26.244
After I gave it to you.

05:30.874 --> 05:32.375
You couldn't part
with that T-shirt?

05:32.459 --> 05:33.960
I love this shirt.

05:34.044 --> 05:36.004
You know, you don't have
to look the way you look.

05:36.087 --> 05:40.717
Amber Rand lost all her clothes in a fire, but
she gets to build herself a new wardrobe.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.928
Let me burn your clothes.

05:43.011 --> 05:45.305
Girls, get down here!
There's a lot of work to do!

05:45.430 --> 05:48.183
She's in a mood. You
know what we have to do, right?

05:48.308 --> 05:50.560
There's no way you're my real sister!
I hate you!

05:50.685 --> 05:52.646
I can't believe- You're the
most selfish, shallow-

05:52.729 --> 05:55.982
That's it! I cannot take the fighting!
Just get out of the house.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.443
Works every time.

05:58.527 --> 06:02.113
You know, I don't even want to drive the truck
anymore, even though on the farm I was-

06:02.197 --> 06:03.698
I can't take
another farm story.

06:03.823 --> 06:05.825
Yay! You might want to
take someone with you.

06:05.909 --> 06:07.702
The thing's been parked there
six months.

06:07.786 --> 06:10.205
You're gonna want to
hose it down, sweep for spiders.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.582
Good news, girls.
You're goin' with Uncle Cam.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.960
Huh?

06:16.127 --> 06:17.587
The pain must've
been pretty bad...

06:17.671 --> 06:19.214
if I was asking Phil for help.

06:19.297 --> 06:22.133
His need for my approval
is exhausting.

06:22.217 --> 06:26.763
In 10 years, I've asked him for one
thing- to hook up my wireless printer.

06:26.846 --> 06:28.723
He still won't shut up about it.

06:28.848 --> 06:31.977
How's that
printer workin' out for you?

06:33.853 --> 06:35.772
Still lovin' that printer, huh?

06:35.855 --> 06:38.066
If your printer breaks from
here, I can fix it on my phone.

06:38.191 --> 06:42.696
Can you? I can, but I don't need
to, because I fixed it forever.

06:42.779 --> 06:46.449
Just once, I wish he wouldn't make
such a big deal about everything.

06:48.827 --> 06:54.457
Okay. Now just disrobe and place
the towel over your buttocks.

07:02.591 --> 07:05.302
Ridin' the open
road in a big rig like this...

07:05.385 --> 07:08.013
sure can work up
a man's powerful appetite.

07:08.096 --> 07:09.556
We've gone five blocks.

07:09.681 --> 07:11.641
Do you want a
burger or not? I could eat.

07:11.725 --> 07:15.520
Hey, Alex, maybe Uncle Cam will
let you borrow his hat later.

07:15.645 --> 07:18.982
You know, since you dress like a dude.
I like the way I dress.

07:19.107 --> 07:23.612
Uncle Cam, as her future prom date, will
you please talk to her? You know fashion.

07:23.695 --> 07:25.989
First of all, you're each
beautiful in your own way.

07:26.072 --> 07:28.617
But you're both playing for second,
because I'm too sexy for this truck.

07:28.742 --> 07:32.704
I have to say, you do drive it surprisingly well.
Yeah, who'd have thought?

07:33.913 --> 07:35.457
Surprising?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.667
What, that-that a gay man
can drive a truck?

07:37.751 --> 07:41.296
You know, I expect that kind of
thinking from Jay's generation.

07:41.379 --> 07:44.049
But from our future generation?
No.

07:44.132 --> 07:47.177
Wow. This place got crowded.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.346
Oh. You're
really wedged in there.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.222
You want us to help
guide you out?

07:52.265 --> 07:55.435
That question?
It was like a hate crime.

08:01.483 --> 08:02.984
Sorry!

08:03.068 --> 08:05.236
- Hey, you're really close on this side.
- Yeah, I see it.

08:05.862 --> 08:07.906
- Careful!
- I'm being careful.

08:09.741 --> 08:12.410
Gasping? Really?

08:16.623 --> 08:18.750
Holding hands.
We're not in a nosedive.

08:20.418 --> 08:23.046
Look, if it would make you
feel better, get out and guide me.

08:23.129 --> 08:25.215
Okay, come on.
Let's go.

08:25.298 --> 08:27.300
Please don't yell at me,
but there's not enough room.

08:27.384 --> 08:29.135
Okay, climb over.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.017
You're fine.

08:41.106 --> 08:46.236
You know, the Native Americans believed
that burning sage kept bad energy away.

08:46.319 --> 08:49.989
How'd that work out for 'em?
Get to the back.

08:50.073 --> 08:52.200
That's the spirit.

08:52.283 --> 08:54.327
Thank you.

08:54.411 --> 08:58.665
Now I just need to make sure
that the oil is a perfect 98.6.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.086
And it is perfect.

09:04.963 --> 09:07.882
Now, I want you to take
a deep breath,

09:07.966 --> 09:13.596
and let me transport you
to a land I call Relaxistan.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.015
Oh, what the hell?
Get off me!

09:16.099 --> 09:17.642
I knew this was a terrible-

09:19.352 --> 09:21.062
Oh, Mama Lucian,
that's good.

09:21.146 --> 09:23.064
Shh.

09:25.275 --> 09:26.901
Shh.

09:28.903 --> 09:30.405
So you want to try it?

09:30.488 --> 09:32.198
Uh, I don't know.
I'm still feeling guilty.

09:32.282 --> 09:34.033
It's Reuben's helicopter.

09:34.117 --> 09:36.911
Reuben is the whole reason
we should be doing this.

09:36.995 --> 09:40.832
He's barely-living proof that
life can change in a second.

09:40.915 --> 09:43.501
You gotta grab what you can
when you can.

09:43.585 --> 09:46.004
What is this hold
you have on me?

09:47.922 --> 09:48.923
Wow.

09:49.007 --> 09:50.967
- Okay, now ease up.
- Okay, I'm easing up.

09:51.050 --> 09:54.971
- Okay, it's not working.
- Get ahold of yourself, Manny! She's getting away!

09:55.054 --> 09:58.516
- I can't hold her!
- Give it to me! Mayday! Mayday!

10:01.436 --> 10:04.230
Oh, well. What do you mean, "Oh, well"?
My mom's gonna kill us.

10:04.314 --> 10:06.024
Us?
You were flying it.

10:06.107 --> 10:07.942
I was in the attic,
packing boxes.

10:08.026 --> 10:10.695
You're gonna help me find it, or
the next search will be for you.

10:11.780 --> 10:14.324
I like this guy.
Where's he been?

10:15.283 --> 10:18.161
Just relax.

10:18.244 --> 10:19.746
Let me know
if I'm hurting you.

10:19.829 --> 10:22.040
Are you kidding me?
it's fantastic.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.376
I love you.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.046
This.
I love this.

10:28.129 --> 10:31.633
It just slipped out. Those are the
worst three words I could say to Phil.

10:31.716 --> 10:34.844
I was just praying he would let it
go and not make a big deal about it.

10:34.928 --> 10:38.890
Oh, my God.
This is huge.

10:38.973 --> 10:41.976
Jay, I'm sorry.
I need a minute.

10:43.102 --> 10:45.563
Son of a bitch!

10:48.566 --> 10:50.068
Son of a bitch.

10:50.151 --> 10:53.071
Oh, these are fantastic. Why
is Manny getting rid of 'em?

10:53.154 --> 10:54.781
He said that
they were last season.

10:54.864 --> 10:57.158
I used to have a pair like these.
I can never find 'em anymore.

10:57.242 --> 10:59.160
Oh, there's an outlet store.

10:59.244 --> 11:03.581
They don't have men's size, but I'm sure the
biggest size for boys will fit you perfectly.

11:03.665 --> 11:05.667
- I'll take you.
- All right, it's a date.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.836
Oh. Another date.

11:07.919 --> 11:09.963
Claire, I heard what
happened with the vase,

11:10.046 --> 11:12.590
but I don't want you
to worry about it.

11:12.674 --> 11:15.301
I'm so sorry. I should've
told you about that sooner.

11:15.385 --> 11:19.389
I just- I have really been
shaken by this whole fire thing.

11:19.472 --> 11:21.933
You know,
life is... so fragile.

11:22.016 --> 11:24.477
I know.
Like a vase.

11:28.314 --> 11:29.858
You tattled on me?

11:29.941 --> 11:32.485
She asked me about it.
What was I supposed to do?

11:36.573 --> 11:38.658
Why are you making those cruel
sounds with your mouth?

11:38.741 --> 11:42.620
You don't see it? You're
turning Gloria into Mom.

11:42.704 --> 11:43.663
What?
Mm-hmm.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.415
First, you got
all defensive of her,

11:45.498 --> 11:47.166
and then
you tattled on me to her.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.878
That's exactly what you did with old Mom.
It's what you're doing with new Mom.

11:49.961 --> 11:53.464
Okay, okay. Only you could make my
friendship with Gloria into something ugly.

11:53.548 --> 11:55.049
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's sweet.

11:55.133 --> 11:58.052
We've all got our thing.
You have mommy issues.

11:58.136 --> 12:00.138
I do not have mommy issues.

12:00.221 --> 12:02.599
Okay, so I pick you up
tomorrow.

12:02.682 --> 12:04.267
We go get you
your big boy pants,

12:04.350 --> 12:06.603
and then we go and get
a little ice cream, okay?

12:07.854 --> 12:09.480
Perfect.

12:10.231 --> 12:12.191
I don't want to hear it.

12:12.275 --> 12:16.029
Ay. You still
don't feel very good?

12:16.112 --> 12:17.530
I told Phil I loved him.

12:17.655 --> 12:20.241
Oh- it was an accident, but you
know how he gets with that stuff.

12:20.325 --> 12:21.492
Ay, I know.

12:21.576 --> 12:24.412
Jay, can I talk to you later
about what just happened?

12:24.495 --> 12:25.705
Yeah.
Thanks.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.290
Geez,
I just worked that out.

12:29.918 --> 12:31.961
You're screwed.

12:32.045 --> 12:34.923
Today is the biggest day
of my life.

12:35.006 --> 12:38.051
Just relax.

12:38.134 --> 12:39.886
Let me know
if I'm hurting you.

12:40.011 --> 12:42.138
Are you kidding me?
it's fantastic.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.057
I love you.

12:44.140 --> 12:46.601
This.
I love this.

12:46.684 --> 12:50.438
Oh, my God.
This is huge.

12:50.521 --> 12:53.608
Jay, I'm sorry.
I need a minute.

12:53.691 --> 12:55.193
The two guys
who left the firm...

12:55.276 --> 12:57.612
asked me to quit my job and partner
with them at the new agency.

12:57.695 --> 13:01.240
Big opportunity,
big risk.

13:01.324 --> 13:04.118
And they need an answer
by the end of the day.

13:04.202 --> 13:06.704
I don't always make great
decisions under pressure.

13:07.413 --> 13:08.957
What the hell is that?

13:09.040 --> 13:11.250
An alpaca.
I got the last one!

13:15.296 --> 13:17.048
Come on, man! Move that truck!

13:17.131 --> 13:18.883
I hate you!

13:18.967 --> 13:22.804
Okay, so I flirted with a table of
truckers who have offered to help us.

13:22.887 --> 13:25.390
No! No help!
I've come too far.

13:25.473 --> 13:27.141
Have you?

13:27.225 --> 13:30.061
Hey, they don't sell pizzas at this restaurant!
You parked here illegally.

13:30.144 --> 13:32.939
Congratulations, sir.
You're destroying America.

13:33.064 --> 13:35.400
Hey, there are no cars behind us.
Go. Gun it!

13:39.570 --> 13:41.197
- on! on!
- All right! Okay!

13:41.280 --> 13:43.616
All right, everybody, relax!
We're fine! We're fine!

13:43.741 --> 13:45.576
We are not fine!
And we're all smushed!

13:45.702 --> 13:48.037
And we're scared! And we're
tilted at a 30 degree angle!

13:48.121 --> 13:50.540
Nerd! And we're dirty
and tired and late!

13:50.665 --> 13:52.417
Okay, can
you please just be quiet?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.168
Why couldn't we have just
asked for help?

13:54.252 --> 13:55.837
'Cause I'm teaching you girls
a very valuable lesson-

13:55.920 --> 13:58.256
that gay men can do anything
straight men can do.

13:58.339 --> 14:01.676
Yeah, we know that. Do you think
you're the only gay guy that we know?

14:01.801 --> 14:04.095
Yeah. My soccer coach is gay.
Our pediatrician.

14:04.220 --> 14:06.556
My Latin tutor. Nerd!
Our electrician.

14:06.639 --> 14:09.058
Then why were you so surprised
when I said I could drive a truck?

14:09.183 --> 14:12.228
Not because you're gay, because you're you.
And by the way, you can't.

14:12.311 --> 14:14.188
Okay, wow. I guess I
owe you an apology.

14:14.272 --> 14:16.899
I made a leap there. I'm just
used to dealing with stereotypes.

14:16.983 --> 14:18.484
I'm a little sensitive
about it.

14:18.568 --> 14:20.611
Oh. Hey, there's that trucker
that I talked to. Hey!

14:20.695 --> 14:23.573
Excuse me. Hi! Could you
give us a hand, please?

14:23.656 --> 14:24.866
Sure thing, sweetie.

14:24.991 --> 14:27.493
Oh, like she'll
be able to help us.

14:31.581 --> 14:34.208
Oh, boy, do you have
the right idea.

14:34.292 --> 14:37.712
I could use a little break from the mother
and child reunion going on down there.

14:37.795 --> 14:39.422
Don't ask.

14:43.051 --> 14:45.595
Mitchell's turning Gloria into Mom.
Barn! it's out. Hmm.

14:46.888 --> 14:49.098
You remember the way Mom
and Mitchell used to be...

14:49.182 --> 14:51.434
in their private little club?

14:51.517 --> 14:54.312
Just the two of them,
no one else allowed in.

14:54.395 --> 14:57.815
Well-
it's happening again.

14:58.816 --> 15:00.443
But this time around,

15:00.526 --> 15:03.362
it's happening with your wife.

15:03.446 --> 15:04.614
You should see them down there.

15:06.157 --> 15:09.577
It'd actually be adorable
if it weren't so sick.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.370
I just-

15:11.454 --> 15:15.583
You know, I feel like Mitchell
is a grown man, he has a child,

15:15.666 --> 15:20.213
and he's still working out some
psychodrama from 20 years ago.

15:21.589 --> 15:23.883
Daddy, can I have a sip of your beer?
Thanks.

15:27.929 --> 15:30.848
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

15:32.308 --> 15:35.436
Mitchell cozies up to Morn.
I go running to Daddy.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.939
I'm the one
who's turning Gloria into Morn,

15:38.022 --> 15:40.274
which is really disturbing,
since we're the same age.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.694
You're older.
Oh.

15:43.778 --> 15:45.863
Oh, that's where
we're gonna chime in.

15:46.948 --> 15:49.617
Will you hurry up?
I'm saving my strength,

15:49.700 --> 15:52.286
'cause if we don't find this
helicopter, I'm walking to Canada.

15:52.370 --> 15:54.872
Hope you like taxes.

15:54.956 --> 15:56.958
Hey, that's our helicopter!

15:57.041 --> 16:00.253
Is it, now? I'm sure you have the
proper documentation for that.

16:00.336 --> 16:02.213
Just give it back.
it's ours.

16:02.338 --> 16:05.424
You guys are bullies. They can't be bullies.
They're nerds.

16:05.508 --> 16:06.926
Don't pigeonhole us.
We can be both.

16:08.511 --> 16:09.470
Oh.

16:09.554 --> 16:12.682
ls there an issue here?

16:12.765 --> 16:15.059
Uncle Cam,
I got this.

16:19.564 --> 16:21.607
Oh, my God, it's Alex Dunphy.
So awesome.

16:21.691 --> 16:23.568
What's the problem here, boys?

16:23.651 --> 16:26.863
These geeks won't give us back our
helicopter that we took from Reuben.

16:26.946 --> 16:28.447
Is that right,
Abraham?

16:28.531 --> 16:29.991
Oh, my God,
she knows your name.

16:30.074 --> 16:31.242
Helicopter, please.

16:37.623 --> 16:38.749
I love you.

16:39.417 --> 16:40.918
What just happened?

16:41.002 --> 16:43.838
You have your fans,
I have mine.

16:43.921 --> 16:47.508
Someday, your fans are
going to work for my fans.

16:51.554 --> 16:54.473
Oh. Um, Gloria, do you mind if I
talk to Mitchell alone for a minute?

16:54.557 --> 16:58.269
It's okay. I already know what you
said, and I think it's crazy.

16:58.352 --> 17:00.271
Mitchell is not making me
his mommy.

17:00.354 --> 17:03.774
No, I know, he's not.
But I think that I might be.

17:03.858 --> 17:08.112
Okay, now you're going really, really
crazy, because I am younger than you.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.948
Mmm, by 14 months,
so let's settle down.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.492
What is going
on with you today?

17:13.576 --> 17:16.078
I- All right,
I'm working this out as I go.

17:18.289 --> 17:22.084
I think maybe seeing you get all
buddy-buddy today with Gloria...

17:22.167 --> 17:25.838
made me feel like it did
when you were with Morn.

17:25.922 --> 17:29.967
And-And- I don't know,
I-l felt like the odd man out.

17:30.051 --> 17:32.595
Okay. Well, that's how I used
to feel with you and Dad.

17:33.346 --> 17:34.639
I know.

17:34.722 --> 17:38.809
I know. We-We chose teams,
even during the divorce, and-

17:41.020 --> 17:46.692
Okay, the last couple of years, you and
I have been our own team, you know?

17:46.776 --> 17:49.195
And I don't want that
to go away.

17:49.320 --> 17:53.991
So, I guess I just felt a
little left out today. Shutup.

17:56.077 --> 17:58.537
Okay, can you two
try hugging a box...

17:58.621 --> 18:01.749
so that your poor mother doesn't
have to do all the hard work?

18:01.832 --> 18:04.377
I am sorry, Gloria,
about all the mom stuff today.

18:04.460 --> 18:08.422
I just- I got this crazy idea that
you like Mitchell better than me.

18:08.506 --> 18:10.508
I do like Mitchell
better than you.

18:10.591 --> 18:11.592
Why?

18:11.676 --> 18:13.010
Ay, please.

18:13.094 --> 18:14.679
Are you going to
honestly tell me...

18:14.762 --> 18:17.014
that I'm your favorite
person in this family?

18:17.098 --> 18:19.976
I'm not even your favorite
Colombian in this family.

18:20.059 --> 18:23.229
I would love to get closer to you.
You have my number.

18:23.312 --> 18:26.941
But call me quickly,
because I book up.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.111
You never saw me!

18:33.948 --> 18:36.325
There you are. I really
need to talk to you.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.744
You really don't. Jay, please.
it's about work.

18:38.828 --> 18:40.454
I got a text
during your massage.

18:40.538 --> 18:42.498
I've been offered a
partnership in a new agency.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.417
Oh.

18:46.002 --> 18:48.462
Good for you.
Well, I'm not so sure.

18:48.546 --> 18:52.508
I mean, there's-there's a big upside,
but I have a stable job right now.

18:52.591 --> 18:55.136
I have three kids, and at least
one of 'em's going to college.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.430
Worst-case scenario,
they all go.

18:57.513 --> 18:59.098
Well, what does Claire think?

19:00.433 --> 19:03.227
I haven't told her yet. I
wanted to talk to you first.

19:03.311 --> 19:04.812
You've done this.

19:04.895 --> 19:08.357
Well, I think that there's
only really one question.

19:08.441 --> 19:10.109
Whether I'm ready
to run my own company?

19:10.192 --> 19:13.321
Nah, you're great with people.
We know you're a good salesman.

19:13.404 --> 19:16.282
You've managed to provide
a good living in tough times.

19:16.365 --> 19:17.825
Then what?
Is this the right time?

19:17.908 --> 19:20.036
Never a perfect time.
House could burn down tomorrow.

19:20.119 --> 19:23.622
Question is, do you want this?

19:24.957 --> 19:27.543
Yeah.
Yeah, I really want it.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.879
Then gamble on yourself.

19:31.255 --> 19:33.215
I'd gamble on you.

19:35.301 --> 19:36.260
I'm gonna do it.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.054
There you go.

19:38.137 --> 19:39.889
Thanks, Jay.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.183
Hey, look, I know you were
reluctant to get that massage,

19:42.266 --> 19:44.769
but I think we can both agree
it had a happy ending.

19:46.604 --> 19:48.064
Please don't say that.

19:48.147 --> 19:51.484
If I could only save
one possession in a fire-

19:51.567 --> 19:54.904
Probably my first set of golf clubs.
My old man gave 'em to me.

19:55.029 --> 19:56.906
Here, I got it.
No,no,no.

19:58.616 --> 20:01.619
The engagement ring that
Jay gave me that changed my life.

20:02.745 --> 20:04.330
Lily's adoption papers.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.332
I Was gonna
say adoption papers.

20:06.415 --> 20:09.877
So I guess then I would say
my mama's recipe book.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.547
All our family photos...

20:13.631 --> 20:16.092
which I keep on my iPad,
so my iPad.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.970
As long as I had my family,
I wouldn't need anything else.

20:20.054 --> 20:22.390
What?

20:22.473 --> 20:25.267
You say somethin' like that,
it makes us all seem petty.

20:25.351 --> 20:27.895
Yeah. I know. I know.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.606
Boo!

20:31.816 --> 20:32.817
Hiss!

20:38.280 --> 20:40.324
Shh. Cam's sleeping.
I don't want to wake him.

20:40.408 --> 20:41.450
He's had a rough day.

20:41.534 --> 20:43.035
Not as rough
as Grandpa's truck.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.663
Shh.

20:45.746 --> 20:46.914
Thank you so much for driving
me.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.707
I really didn't want to ride
in that big rig.

20:48.791 --> 20:50.209
It was amazing.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.003
Everybody was honking, and I
learned, like, five new curse words.

20:53.129 --> 20:54.505
Mostly from Cam.
Shh!

20:55.881 --> 20:57.675
I'm glad
I could give you a laugh today.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.052
I didn't know that's what I was
to you people, a big joke.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.346
No, honey, it wasn't like that.
No, we didn't mean-

21:02.430 --> 21:04.682
- Uncle Cam, we love you.
- Save it.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.183
I'm going back to bed.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.103
So he's still doing that?

21:09.186 --> 21:11.188
Yeah, yeah. But we're
workin' on it.
